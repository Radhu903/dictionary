<p>Plant breeders usually aim at complete resistance, in which the virus cannot establish a systemic infection. ELISA and molecular hybridization have been used to test germplasm and cultivars for resistance since a good number of plants can be analyzed simultaneously (

When a complete resistance is not possible, breeding for relative or partial resistance (reduction of virus accumulation) or tolerance (reduction of virus damage without affecting virus multiplication) can be a good alternative. The most precise technique to evaluate the level of relative resistance is real-time qPCR (

 <xref rid="B232" ref-type="bibr">Soler et al., 2015</xref>). Time-course assays can be used to evaluate relative resistance (that can be measured by ELISA or molecular hybridization) and relative tolerance (measured by observation of symptoms as a proxy of damage). The levels of resistance or tolerance can be estimated as the probability of no infection or no symptoms, respectively, by survival analyses (
