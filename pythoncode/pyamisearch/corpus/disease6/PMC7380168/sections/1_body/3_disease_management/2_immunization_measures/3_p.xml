<p>However, breeding resistant cultivars is unsuitable for many crops and viruses because of the scarcity of resistance genes found in genetically compatible relatives. An alternative may be to change the specificity or range of known resistance genes by artificial evolution so they can confer resistance to novel viruses or virus strains. This approach is based on generating large populations of random mutants from a resistance gene by PCR with a high error rate, followed by the selection of those variants showing the desired resistance properties. Resistance is evaluated by 
 <italic>Agrobacterium</italic>-mediated transient co-expression of each resistance gene mutant and the Avr from the challenge virus in 
 <italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic> leaves so the resistance response is observed as a necrotic lesion. This approach has been used to broaden the resistance specificity of the potato gene
