<p>Introgression of resistance genes from cultivated or wild species into susceptible related crops by backcrossing (plant breeding) is the most widely-used immunization method. There are two types: i) active resistance driven by resistance proteins, encoded by dominant alleles, which recognize specifically a sequence or conformational pattern of a virus gene (avirulence determinant, Avr) and induces death of the infected cells (hypersensitive response), precluding virus movement to adjacent cells and systemic infection (
