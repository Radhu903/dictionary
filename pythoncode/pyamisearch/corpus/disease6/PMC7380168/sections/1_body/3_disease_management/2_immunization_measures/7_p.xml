<p>Another strategy to obtain resistant plants is based on the RNA silencing mechanism. RNA silencing is a regulatory mechanism of gene expression in eukaryotes and a natural antiviral defense mechanism. The host RNA silencing machinery targets dsRNA that arise from replicative viral intermediates or secondary structures in the genomic RNA due to internal complementarity, which are detected by RNases (Dicer-like proteins) and cleaved into small RNA duplexes (siRNA or miRNAs) of 21–24 nucleotides (nt) in length. One of the two strands of the small RNAs is recruited to the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) that subsequently cleaves cognate viral RNAs in a sequence-specific manner. These cleaved RNAs are recognized by RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RDR), which amplifies the dsRNA molecules, thus contributing to the amplification of the host defense mechanism that results in effective inhibition of local and systemic viral infection (

 <xref rid="B256" ref-type="bibr">Voinnet et al., 1999</xref>), which can act in different steps of the silencing pathway, either by binding siRNA duplex or by directly interacting with key components of the RNA silencing machinery. Some synergetic interactions between coinfecting viruses (increasing viral accumulation or symptoms) are caused by the cumulative effect of the silencing suppressors of both viruses (
 <xref rid="B234" ref-type="bibr">Syller, 2012</xref>). Resistance can be obtained by plant transformation, introducing into plants DNA constructs to produce viral dsRNAs or ssRNA with some degree of secondary structure to trigger RNA silencing. Since RNA silencing requires a certain nucleotide identity between the targeted virus and the transgene, it is necessary to evaluate the nucleotide variation of the virus population as explained above. The best technique to evaluate the efficiency of the RNA silencing-based resistances is real-time qPCR.
