<p>Plant breeders are keen on the host genetic variability, but often they neglect the virus genetic variability, which should be considered when new resistance genes are tested to minimize the possibility of resistance breakdown. Multiplex real-time qPCR is well-suited to evaluate the effect of mixed infections in overcoming resistance. Detection of virus variants with punctual mutations leading to resistance breakdown would be a valuable tool to monitor the dispersion of these variants. However, this has proved to be a difficult task as in most cases resistance breakdown occurs by only one nucleotide substitution (producing one amino acid change). The presence of other neutral substitutions around the critical mutation hinders the design of molecular markers for resistance breakdown. Real-time qPCR with Taqman probes has been developed to detect single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with resistance breakdown for beet necrotic yellow vein virus (BNYVV) and tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV) (
