<p>Resistance can be ineffective for some virus variants or be overcome by i) interaction with other viruses in mixed infections (

 <xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr">García-Cano et al., 2006</xref>), ii) positive selection of punctual mutations (

 <xref rid="B142" ref-type="bibr">López et al., 2011</xref>) or iii) recombination or reassortment events (

 <xref rid="B154" ref-type="bibr">Miras et al., 2014</xref>). Plant genes conferring dominant resistance usually target viral protein domains whose function is essential for the virus biology (replication, movement, transmission) and are under strong negative selection. Thus, it is difficult for the virus to fix the mutations producing resistance breakdown. In some cases, overcoming the resistance implemented in a cultivar by plant breeding involves a tradeoff leading to a loss of the virus fitness in non-resistant hosts, thus limiting the cases of emergence and spread of resistance-breaking isolates in the field (
 <xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">García-Arenal and McDonald, 2003</xref>). Polygenic resistance is more durable, but resistance implemented in most breeding programs is monogenic because its introgression in the crops is easier (
 <xref rid="B181" ref-type="bibr">Palloix et al., 2009</xref>). Understanding the molecular, evolutionary and epidemiological factors involved in the emergence of resistance-breaking virus isolates is progressing (
 <xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">García-Arenal and McDonald, 2003</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">Elena et al., 2014</xref>), but predicting the durability of new resistances remains elusive and it needs to be tested in the field.
