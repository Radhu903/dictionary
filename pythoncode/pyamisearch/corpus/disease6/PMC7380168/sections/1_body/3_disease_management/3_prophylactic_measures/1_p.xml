<p>Quarantine (control of borders) and sanitary certification of virus-free germplasm (seeds or asexual propagative tissues) are the first measures to prevent the introduction and emergence of new viruses in a geographical area. Virus detection should be based on sensitive and broad-spectrum methods, since discarding healthy material is preferable to the risk of spreading new diseases. On-site detection devices can be useful to make decisions quickly, thus preventing importation and exportation delays. HTS is the most powerful detection procedure since it can detect all the viruses (known and unknown) present in a plant in an unbiased way. Its use in quarantine and clean plant programs is increasing as it is becoming more economically affordable (
