<p>Sanitation, that is, removing viruses from valuable cultivars, is necessary when no healthy plants are available. Virus-free plants are usually produced by thermotherapy, chemotherapy, electrotherapy, and tissue culture alone or combined (

 <xref rid="B110" ref-type="bibr">Hull, 2002</xref>). Chemotherapy is based on antiviral drugs to inhibit or disrupt specific steps of the virus life cycle, e.g., nucleoside analogs inhibiting replication and protease inhibitors preventing protein processing. Antiviral drugs are costly and are used only to regenerate healthy mother plants for vegetative propagation or seed production (
 <xref rid="B182" ref-type="bibr">Panattoni et al., 2013</xref>). The sanitated plants must be evaluated and confirmed to be virus-free with very sensitive techniques such as real-time qPCR. Nucleoside analogs can also be used to increase the already high mutation rate of RNA viruses, so that the excess of mutations would lead to a loss of genetic information and virus extinction (lethal mutagenesis or error catastrophe). This approach has been assayed recently with a plant virus, tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), resulting in a loss of viral infectivity (
