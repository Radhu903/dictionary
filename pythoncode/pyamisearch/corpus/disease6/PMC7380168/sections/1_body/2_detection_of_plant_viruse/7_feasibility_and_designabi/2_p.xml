<p>Sample processing is a critical step and affects the rapidity, easiness and throughput of the detection process. Molecular hybridization and PCR techniques require purification of total RNA or DNA from plants to remove substances inhibiting the detection process (yielding false negatives) or producing a background signal (yielding false positives). Inhibition of PCR can be avoided or minimized by diluting the extracts or by immunocapture (

Libraries can be enriched in viral sequences by using as starting material preparations from which host nucleic acids have been removed by subtractive hybridization or using purified viral particles, double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) preparations, which are enriched in replicative intermediates of RNA viruses, or small RNAs resulting from RNA silencing that is a plant response to virus infection (
