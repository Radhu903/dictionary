<p>Isothermal amplification can be achieved by different approaches (
 <xref rid="B177" ref-type="bibr">Olmos et al., 2007</xref>): i) Helicase dependent amplification (HAD) uses a helicase to separate the strands of dsDNA, allowing primer binding and extension by DNA polymerase at a constant temperature of about 65°C. ii) Recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) uses a recombinase which forms a complex with primers to initiate amplification at a temperature between 37°C and 42°C. iii) Nucleic acid sequence-based amplification method (NASBA) uses a modified primer with the bacteriophage T7 promoter region that attaches to the RNA template. Reverse transcriptase and RNase H are used to synthesize complementary ds DNA, and a T7 RNA polymerase to synthesize complementary RNA strands resulting in amplification. iv) Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is based on auto cycling and high DNA strand displacement activity mediated by Bst polymerase from
