<p>HTS enables accurate and unbiased identification of viruses unlike the other techniques (ELISA, molecular hybridization or amplification) requiring a specific binding that can fail to detect some genetic variants. HTS generates hundreds of megabases to gigabases of nucleotide sequence reads in a single run providing a good sensitivity (
