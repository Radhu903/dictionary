<p>Low virus titer can limit sensitivity, producing false negativesÂ when the virus concentration is under the technique detection threshold. Usually, the molecular techniques are more sensitive than the serological ones. Conventional PCR is much more sensitive than molecular hybridization. Some modalities of PCR are even more sensitive, such as qPCR and nested PCR (this uses two successive runs of PCR with a second primer pair to amplify a secondary target within the product of the first run). LAMP exhibits a sensitivity in the order of qPCR and is less affected than PCR by inhibitors (phenols, tannins, and complex polysaccharides), which are often a cause of false negatives. Paradoxically, the high sensitivity of the amplification techniques can be a problem, as contamination of reagents and instruments with amplicons from previous samples and cross-contamination between samples can produce false positives reducing specificity.</p>
