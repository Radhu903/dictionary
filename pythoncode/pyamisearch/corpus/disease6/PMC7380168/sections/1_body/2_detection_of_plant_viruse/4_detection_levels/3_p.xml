<p>PCR techniques are the most versatile and primers have been designed for different detection levels from families and genera (

 </xref>) to strains and genetic variants (

 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Debreczeni et al., 2011</xref>), whereas isothermal amplification has been limited to the species level (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">
  <bold>Supplementary Table S3</bold>
 </xref>). Obtaining primers specific for genera or families is more challenging than for virus species given the increasing nucleotide diversity of higher taxons. Primer design requires searching for conserved nucleotide positions among the members of the genus or family, which usually correspond to sequence motifs with relevant biological functions, and therefore, subjected to strong negative selection. The conserved positions can occur at the nucleotide level due to structural constraints, codon usage, or at sites where regulatory proteins bind (

 <xref rid="B258" ref-type="bibr">Watters et al., 2017</xref>), but most are at amino acid level. For example, primers for the subfamily

 <italic>Comovirus</italic>, 
 <italic>Fabavirus</italic> and 
 <italic>Nepovirus</italic>) were designed based on amino acid motifs of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase: (T/V)YGDDN(V/L) and TSEG(Y/F)P (
