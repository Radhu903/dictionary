<p>On-site detection of plant viruses is an interesting feature allowing a prompt response. Presently, several techniques are commercially available (
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">Donoso and Valenzuela, 2018</xref>). Lateral flow assay (LFA) consists of a chromatographic test strip where crude plant extracts are dropped and move capillarily. The virus is detected when a stained band appears by binding virions with labeled antibodies or viral nucleic acids with labeled DNA or RNA probes (

 <xref rid="B125" ref-type="bibr">Koczula and Gallotta, 2016</xref>). This procedure takes only about 15 to 30 min. LFA has been used for multiplex detection of potato viruses (

RPA and LAMP isothermal amplification can be performed with crude plant extracts in portable hot blocks and results can be displayed with a portable fluorescence reader or a lateral flow strip so the whole process can take about 45 min.
