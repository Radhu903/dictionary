<p>Serological techniques usually detect viruses to the species level and, in some cases, they allow discrimination between virus strains (serotypes) using monoclonal antibodies (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">
  <bold>Supplementary Table S1</bold>
 </xref>), but the detection level can be modified to a certain extent by using different probes and hybridization conditions. The stability of the hybrid complexes depends on the probe length and G-C content, the probe type (DNA or RNA), and the number of global or local mismatches (nucleotide distance) between target and probe. Therefore, the distribution of nucleotide variation along the virus genome should be considered to modulate the level of detection and to test for accuracy. Regarding the hybridization conditions, a more selective detection can be attained by using more stringent conditions (higher incubation temperature, lower salt concentration or adding denaturing agents like formamide), that reduce the number of mismatches permitted to occur. Thus, probes from variable genomic regions with stringent conditions have been used to discriminate between virus strains or isolates (

 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">Ferrer et al., 2008</xref>). Designing probes complementary to regions conserved within taxonomic units higher than species is challenging given the high nucleotide variation among species. To our knowledge, only two cases have been reported: i) A single RNA probe derived from the 5′ untranslated of BBWV-1 was able to hybridize with other members of the genus

 <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">Ferriol et al., 2015</xref>). This genomic region contains several perfect or near-perfect repeats of ten nucleotides that allow hybridization despite the low nucleotide identity between these virus species. ii) A polyprobe with seven conserved motifs of the genus 
 <italic>Potyvirus</italic> allowed detection of 32 viruses of this genus by hybridizing at low stringency conditions (
