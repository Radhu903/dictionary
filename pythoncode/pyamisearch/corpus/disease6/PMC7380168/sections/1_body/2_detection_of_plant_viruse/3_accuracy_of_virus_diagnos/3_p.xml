<p>An important factor affecting the accuracy of the serological and molecular detection methods is the genetic variability within each virus species and the genetic relationships with other virus species. Since these methods are based on specific binding (protein with antibody or nucleic acids with probes or primers), some dissimilar virus variants can fail to react giving false negatives. For example, universal detection of PPV by ELISA with monoclonal antibodies failed for some PPV isolates (

However, genetic variation of viruses is often neglected, and accuracy is tested just with samples from local surveys harboring genetically similar virus isolates. Thus, some detection protocols can fail when applied with the same reagents (probes or primers) in other geographical areas or after the emergence of divergent variants, e.g., pepino mosaic virus (PepMV) and apple chlorotic leafspot virus (ACLSV) (
