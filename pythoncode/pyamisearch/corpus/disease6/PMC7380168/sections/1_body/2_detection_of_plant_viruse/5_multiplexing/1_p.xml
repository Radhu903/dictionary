<p>Procedures to detect and identify various viruses or virus strains in a single assay simultaneously reduce time and cost of the analysis (see 
 <xref rid="B180" ref-type="bibr">Pallás et al., 2018</xref> for a comprehensive review), and are especially suitable for evaluating mixed infections in individual plants. The detection of individual viruses in a sample is mainly based on three approaches: i) spatial separation of detection sites (wells or spots); ii) separation of distinctly sized amplicons by electrophoresis; and iii) using a different label for each virus (
