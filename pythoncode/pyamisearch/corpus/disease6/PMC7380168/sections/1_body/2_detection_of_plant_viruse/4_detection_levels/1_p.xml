<p>Detection and identification of viruses are based on assigning a virus from a plant sample to a group of viruses sharing common characteristics. In most cases, the level of detection is the virus species, but it can also be set for higher taxonomic units such as genus or family, or lower units like strain (virus variants with distinctive biological or molecular characteristics).</p>
