<p>Extracts obtained by just grinding plant tissue in buffer can be used for ELISA and LAMP. For some viruses, tissue-prints made by cutting leaf petioles or rolled leaf blades transversely and gently pressing the fresh cut onto nitrocellulose membranes have been analyzed directly with ELISA or molecular hybridization (

An alternative to passive incubation of probes with the targets immobilized onto membranes in solution is the flow-through hybridization, based on directing a probe flow towards the targets immobilized on the membrane, reducing the hybridization time from hours to a few minutes (
