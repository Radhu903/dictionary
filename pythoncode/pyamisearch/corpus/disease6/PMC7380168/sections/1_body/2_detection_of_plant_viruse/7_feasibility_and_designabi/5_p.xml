<p>The ability to develop rapidly new assays is very important given the continuous emergence of new plant viruses. The production of antisera for the serological techniques is lengthy, unpredictable and costly (

In contrast, the setup of molecular detection methods is a directed process that is cheap, fast and versatile, enabling to address different detection levels and consider the genetic variability of virus populations. Primers and oligoprobes are synthesized and commercialized at a low cost. They can be easily designed with many available software algorithms, such as Prime3 (
