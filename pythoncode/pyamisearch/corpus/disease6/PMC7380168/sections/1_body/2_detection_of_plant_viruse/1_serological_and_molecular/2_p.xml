<p>Detection methods based on DNA amplification can be classified into two types: polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and isothermal amplification. PCR makes millions of DNA copies of a specific region of the viral genome that are usually visualized by electrophoresis or by hybridization with fluorescent probes. PCR can use as template genomic DNA, or complementary DNA obtained after reverse transcription (RT) of viral RNA. Amplification occurs in three steps: i) denaturation by heating at 90°C to 95°C to separate the double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) template into single strands; ii) annealing by cooling at 40°C to 60°C to allow the primers (two short DNA sequences of 15–40 nt) to bind the start and end of the target DNA; iii) extension by heating at 70°C to 75°C, in which a thermostable DNA polymerase synthesizes new DNA strands starting from the primers. These steps are repeated for 20 to 40 cycles, so the newly synthesized DNA segments serve as template in next cycles (

The PCR product is visualized by electrophoresis, and it can be further characterized by Sanger sequencing (first-generation sequencing), enabling a more precise identification by comparison with known sequences from databases like GenBank (see below). Also, this approach is used to genotype virus populations, evaluate their genetic diversity, and study their evolution (see below). Real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) is a variant of this technique that monitors the reaction progress by detecting a fluorescent reporter that binds to the dsDNA or is released from sequence-specific probes of 15 to 30 nt. This PCR variant can be used to quantify nucleic acids (see below).
