<p>HTS can be divided into two types. Second-generation sequencing is based on the preparation of random libraries of DNA fragments when DNA is used as starting material, or of cDNA obtained by retrotranscription of the RNA with random primers or oligodT. These libraries are clonally amplified, bond to synthetic DNA adapters and sequenced in parallel. This produces a large number of short sequence reads (100–500 nt) that are assembled by connecting overlapping sequence reads according to nucleotide identity by informatic analysis, e.g., Geneious package (
