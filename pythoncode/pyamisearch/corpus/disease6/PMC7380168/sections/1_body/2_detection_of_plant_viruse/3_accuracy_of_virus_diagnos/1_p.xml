<p>Detection procedures must be optimized for accuracy, measured as sensitivity and specificity, which are the statistical measures of performance of binary classification tests (
 <xref rid="B226" ref-type="bibr">Sharma et al., 2009</xref>). Sensitivity measures the proportion of actual positives which are classified as such (probability of true positives) and specificity measures the proportion of negatives which are correctly identified (probability of true negatives). Other measures of accuracy are positive predictive value, defined as the proportion of positive samples correctly diagnosed, and negative predictive value, or proportion of samples with negative results correctly diagnosed (

  <bold>Table 2</bold>
 </xref>). However, the predictive values depend on the infection prevalence in the samples tested and do not apply universally (
