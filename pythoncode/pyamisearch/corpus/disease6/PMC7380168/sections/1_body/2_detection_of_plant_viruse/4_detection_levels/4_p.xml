<p>To design primers detecting the members of a genus or family, at least one sequence per each virus species should be used for alignment, preferably a codon-based or amino acid alignment. Since the genetic code is redundant, the primer must be degenerate, that is, composed of a mixture of almost identical primers differing in some positions and covering all possible nucleotide combinations for that protein sequence. The degeneracy level should be reduced as much as possible due to its negative effect in sensitivity (only a small proportion of the primers would bind the target) and specificity (some primers can bind to nontarget sequences). Several approaches can be used, such as i) limiting the degenerate sites to the last 9 to 12 nucleotides from the 3′ terminus, which are critical for PCR amplification, whereas some mispairings at the 5′ terminus are allowed; ii) choosing low degeneracy (one- or two-fold) codons, particularly at the 3′ terminus; and iii) using modified nucleotides such as inosine (I) for four-fold degenerate sites that can base-pair with the four normal nucleotides: A, C, G and T. As an illustration,

 <italic>Fabavirus</italic>, which can be used for a hypothetical universal detection of viruses within this genus. The PCR products obtained with conserved primers for a genus or family can be further purified and sequenced to identify the viral species or discover new ones (

In plants infected with two or more species of the same genus or family, it is necessary to clone the PCR products and sequence individual clones to identify each virus species. In some cases, the PCR products obtained with conserved primers are of distinct size for each virus species and can be easily discriminated by electrophoresis (
