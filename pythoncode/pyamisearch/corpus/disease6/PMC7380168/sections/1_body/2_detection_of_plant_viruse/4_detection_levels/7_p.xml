<p>Recombination can produce biological and genomic variants of a virus that can be very similar in one genome region and very divergent in other. Thus, the complete genome or different regions of it should be analyzed for detection and identification of recombinant variants. Recombination can be detected by comparing nucleotide identity and/or phylogenetic relationships along the genome, which can be performed with different procedures implemented in the package RDP 4 (
 <xref rid="B151" ref-type="bibr">Martin et al., 2015</xref>). For example, identification of CTV strains requires different sets of primers (
 <xref rid="B205" ref-type="bibr">Roy et al., 2010</xref>) as recombination has played an important role in shaping CTV genome (
 <xref rid="B150" ref-type="bibr">Martín et al., 2009</xref>). HTS can be useful to detect recombination since full-length or almost full-length viral genomes are sequenced rapidly, in a single analysis (

 <xref rid="B228" ref-type="bibr">Silva et al., 2019</xref>), unlike genome walking that requires successive steps of PCR, Sanger sequencing and primer design. Third-generation sequencing of single molecules seems more appropriate to identify recombination (
 <xref rid="B250" ref-type="bibr">Viehweger et al., 2019</xref>) than second-generation sequencing methods that can produce recombinant artifacts, as genomic sequences are assembled from short sequences. Nevertheless, it is convenient to confirm the recombinants by PCR followed by Sanger sequencing.
