<p>For universal detection of a virus by PCR, primers should be designed from short sequence stretches with conserved nucleotide positions among all available sequences and they should be degenerated to cover possible genetic variation not found in the sequences analyzed (explained in 
 <italic>Detection Levels</italic>). For example, detection of PepMV by RT-PCR (
 <xref rid="B147" ref-type="bibr">Mansilla et al., 2003</xref>) failed for new PepMV isolates and universal detection was only achieved after designing primers targeting conserved sequence stretches among PepMV isolates (
 <xref rid="B138" ref-type="bibr">Ling et al., 2007</xref>). For molecular hybridization, different genomic regions should be considered for probe design since the genetic diversity can vary widely along the genome due to different selective pressures or recombination. For example, broad bean wilt virus 1 (BBWV-1), with a bipartite single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) genome, showed the lowest nucleotide diversity in the 5′ terminal sequence of RNA 1 (
 <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">Ferriol et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, only a DNA probe binding this genomic region allowed universal detection of BBWV-1 by molecular hybridization (
 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">Ferrer et al., 2008</xref>).
