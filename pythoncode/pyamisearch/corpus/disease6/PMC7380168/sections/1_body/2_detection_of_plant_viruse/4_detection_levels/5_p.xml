<p>Tools to detect small genetic variations are also necessary given the great potential of viruses to generate high genetic and biological variation (genetic variants can display different properties, such as host range, virulence and resistance-breakdown). Several techniques based on PCR or using PCR products as templates have been used for genotyping: i) Randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD)-PCR uses a single short primer with an arbitrary nucleotide sequence (8–12 nucleotides) to produce different random segments depending on the target amplified, which are visualized by electrophoresis. This technique does not require knowledge of the target DNA sequence, but its reproducibility is low and has been applied only for few plant viruses (

This technique has been used to differentiate isolates of some plant viruses, such as prunus necrotic ringspot virus (PNRSV), TYLCV and CTV (

 <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">Font et al., 2007</xref>); iii) Single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis is based on electrophoresis of denatured dsDNA in non-denaturing gels so migration of single-stranded DNA depends on its conformation determined by its nucleotide sequence and the electrophoretic conditions. This technique is very resolutive and can detect small differences, even of a single nucleotide, but it is very sensitive to minute changes in the electrophoretic conditions hindering reproducibility. The main advantage of SSCP analysis is the ability to detect different genetic variants (visualized as electrophoretic bands) within a sample (plant), allowing to assess within-isolate genetic variation rapidly. This technique followed by sequencing of the different haplotypes detected has been used to evaluate the genetic variation of some plant viruses, such as cucumber mosaic virus (CMV), citrus psorosis virus (CPsV) and CTV (
