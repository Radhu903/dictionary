<p>Viral diseases are a major threat to sustainable and productive agriculture worldwide, resulting in losses of several billion dollars every year (

The highest impact occurs with emerging diseases, defined by a rapid increase in disease incidence, geographical range, and/or pathogenicity. The main factors driving virus emergence are: i) the agricultural systems based on monocrops with low genetic diversity and high plant density, which are more vulnerable to pathogens and pests; ii) world trade of plant material (germplasm and live plants) that moves viruses, hosts, and vectors to new regions and environments; iii) the climate change affecting the distribution area of hosts and vectors; and iv) the ability of viruses for rapid evolution and adaptation (
