<p>Presently, curing plants once they have been infected by a virus is not feasible, unlike bacteria or fungi that can be treated with antibacterial or antifungal agents, respectively. So, disease management relies on preventing viruses from entering plants, or getting plants resistant to viral infection, using multiple strategies that must be developed specifically for each virus, host, and environment (pathosystem). Specific tools for virus diagnostics and identification are pivotal to set up and evaluate disease management. Here, the current state and progress of procedures used for virus detection are reviewed, discussing important features such as their sensitivity, specificity, versatility, portability, capacity for multiplexing, and virus quantification and designability. This review also includes basic concepts of genetic diversity and evolution of plant viruses and how they must be considered to improve detection. Finally, the main strategies for disease control are described, showing both the more suitable detection methods and how genetic diversity and evolution of virus populations can affect the efficiency and durability of some control strategies. This review follows a pragmatic approach aimed to guide plant pathologists to design and apply more accurate detection procedures for a more efficient management of viral diseases.</p>
