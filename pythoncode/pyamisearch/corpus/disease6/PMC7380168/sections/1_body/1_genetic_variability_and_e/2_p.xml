<p>The genetic variation produced by mutation and recombination is restricted and structured by the other three evolutionary forces: natural selection, genetic drift, and gene flow. Natural selection is a directional process by which the less fit virus variants will decrease their frequency in the population (negative or purifying selection) as a result of functional restrictions necessary for replication, movement between plant cells, transmission by vectors, and specific interactions between virus and host or virus and vector (

 <xref rid="B188" ref-type="bibr">Peña et al., 2014</xref>). Genetic drift consists of stochastic changes in the frequencies of genomic variants in a finite population due to random sampling occurred during reproduction (
 <xref rid="B158" ref-type="bibr">Moya et al., 2004</xref>). The effect is a reduction of genetic variability and fixation of selectively neutral variants that is more evident after a rapid reduction of the population size by population bottlenecks or founder events, which can occur in different steps of the virus life cycle, such as virus movement between plant cells and transmission by vectors (

Finally, gene flow (migration) among viral populations from distinct geographic areas is another factor shaping the genetic structure and variation, so that high migration rates favor genetic uniformity between populations decreasing the global genetic diversity (
 <xref rid="B158" ref-type="bibr">Moya et al., 2004</xref>). The rapid evolution of plant viruses implies that epidemiological and evolutionary processes interplay, and they must be considered together to understand and prevent viral emergence.
