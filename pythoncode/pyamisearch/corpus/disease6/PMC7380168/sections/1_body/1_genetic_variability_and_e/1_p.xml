<p>Viruses have a great potential for high genetic variability due to their rapid replication and generation of large populations. Viruses with RNA genomes, comprising most plant viruses, and viroids have the highest mutation rate of any group of replicons, since RNA polymerases lack a proofreading activity (
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">Domingo et al., 1996</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">Drake and Holland, 1999</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr">Gago et al., 2009</xref>). The mutation rate is so high that replication from a single RNA molecule gives rise to a population of mutant sequences (haplotypes or variants) grouped around a master sequence, termed quasispecies (
 <xref rid="B106" ref-type="bibr">Holland et al., 1982</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B158" ref-type="bibr">Moya et al., 2004</xref>). Populations of closely related viral or viroidal variants in individual plants have been reported (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Ambrós et al., 1999</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B126" ref-type="bibr">Kong et al., 2000</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr">Gandía et al., 2005</xref>). Viral populations in individual plants can be even more complex, since mixed infections with different virus species (
 <xref rid="B117" ref-type="bibr">Juárez et al., 2013</xref>) or divergent variants of the same virus species (
 <xref rid="B209" ref-type="bibr">Rubio et al., 2001</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B91" ref-type="bibr">Gómez et al., 2009</xref>) are frequent as a consequence of successive inoculations by vectors (e.g., insects). For example, a survey of seven tomato viruses in Sicily, Italy (
 <xref rid="B183" ref-type="bibr">Panno et al., 2012</xref>) showed that most plants (75.5%) presented multiple infections, whereas 17.8% were infected with a single virus, and only 6.7% were free of these viruses (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">
  <bold>Table 1</bold>
 </xref>). Synergistic interactions between different viruses and viroids in mixed infection can lead to increased virulence (symptoms and/or viral accumulation) or even new diseases (
 <xref rid="B257" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2002</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B264" ref-type="bibr">Wintermantel, 2005</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B163" ref-type="bibr">Murphy and Bowen, 2006</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B245" ref-type="bibr">Untiveros et al., 2007</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B234" ref-type="bibr">Syller, 2012</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B156" ref-type="bibr">Moreno and López-Moya, 2020</xref>). Mixed infections of two viruses also enable recombination, which, in addition to mutation, is another source of genetic variation and emergence of new viruses. Recombinants have been described between different species of plant viruses (
 <xref rid="B179" ref-type="bibr">Padidam et al., 1999</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Chare and Holmes, 2006</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Codoñer and Elena, 2008</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Davino et al., 2012</xref>) or divergent viral strains (
 <xref rid="B212" ref-type="bibr">Rubio et al., 2013</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B134" ref-type="bibr">Lian et al., 2013</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">Ferriol et al., 2014</xref>). Recombination seems a frequent event coupled to virus replication (
 <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">Froissart et al., 2005</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B235" ref-type="bibr">Sztuba-Solinska et al., 2011</xref>), so that populations of different recombinants have been found in individual plants (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">

 </xref>) (
 <xref rid="B253" ref-type="bibr">Vives et al., 2005</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B261" ref-type="bibr">Weng et al., 2007</xref>). Recombination in RNA viruses is considered as a mechanism for rapid removal of many deleterious mutations produced during replication and regeneration of functional genomes (
 <xref rid="B158" ref-type="bibr">Moya et al., 2004</xref>).
