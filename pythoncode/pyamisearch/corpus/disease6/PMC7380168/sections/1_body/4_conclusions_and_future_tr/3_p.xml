<p>Presently, disease management relies on preventing introduction of new viruses by border control and certification of virus-free propagative material (e.g., seeds) and preventing virus dispersal in the field. Quarantine and certification require sensitive and broad-spectrum detection methods to minimize escapes such as the use of conserved primers specific for virus genera or families and multiplex procedures (

 </xref>). HTS is the best procedure and it is becoming affordable in quarantine facilities given the devastating consequences of introducing new pathogens. Prophylactic measures to prevent or minimize virus dispersal require information on the virus biology (host range, transmission way, etc.), virus incidence and epidemiology. Obtaining this information needs using high-throughput screening techniques able to analyze a high number of samples such as ELISA and molecular hybridization (

 </xref>). The other keystone for plant disease control is the obtention of resistant cultivars, which is performed mainly by plant breeding and commercialized by seed companies. However, apart from the important effort involved in breeding programs, resistance is not available for most crops and viruses. Genetic engineering, despite the great potential and some remarkable successes (
 <xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">Fuchs and Gonsalves, 2007</xref>), faces heavy opposition in some countries due to the public concern on the potential ecological impact of transgenic plants (
 <xref rid="B115" ref-type="bibr">Jones, 2006</xref>). Resistant plants should be evaluated with specific methods, as resistance depends on host and virus genotypes. Partial resistance can be evaluated by real-time qPCR (

  <bold>Figure 5C</bold>
 </xref>). Genome editing by CRISPR and the application of dsRNA-loaded clay particles to trigger RNA silencing are promising research fields. In any case, to aim at more durable and effective protection, it is necessary to characterize the genetic variability and relationships of plant viruses, as well as the factors and mechanisms involved in genetic change.
