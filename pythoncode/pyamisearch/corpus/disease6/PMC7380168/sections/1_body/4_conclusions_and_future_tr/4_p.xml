<p>HTS excels for its broad-spectrum and multiplex detection, sensitivity, and precise quantification. No previous knowledge is required, enabling unbiased detection and discovery of new viruses. The sequences obtained allow a precise taxonomic assignation and an estimation of genetic relationships with other viruses and viral isolates. It is reasonable to expect that HTS, especially portable nanopore sequencing devices, will become the standard diagnostic procedure as costs will be dropping and analytical procedures improving.</p>
