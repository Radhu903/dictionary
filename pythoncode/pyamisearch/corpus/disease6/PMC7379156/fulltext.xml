Intraperitoneal infection makes the abdominal and pelvic organs accessible to pathogens because of the circulation of peritoneal fluid throughout the pelvis and abdomen. We found that high-dose intraperitoneal infection in mice with influenza A viruses resulted in severe sclerosis and structural damage in the pancreas, disruption of ovarian follicles, and massive infiltration of immune cells in the uterus. The intraperitoneal infections also caused robust upregulation of proinflammatory mediators including IL-6, BLC, and MIG. In addition, low-dose intraperitoneal infection with one influenza strain provided cross-protection against subsequent intraperitoneal or intranasal challenge with another influenza strain. Our results suggest that low-dose, non-respiratory administration might provide a route for influenza vaccination. Furthermore, these results provide insight on the pathological role of influenza A viruses in high-risk patients, including women and diabetic individuals.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>abdominal organs</kwd><kwd>chemokines</kwd><kwd>cytokines</kwd><kwd>infection</kwd><kwd>influenza A virus</kwd><kwd>organ failure</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn001">National Research Foundation of Korea<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100003725</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn001">2020R1A2B5B02001806</award-id><award-id rid="cn001">2019M3A9E4032628</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="6"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="53"/><page-count count="15"/><word-count count="0"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Respiratory influenza infections account for about 290,000&#x02013;650,000 deaths worldwide each year<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="footnote1">1</xref></sup>. Accordingly, studies of the pathogenesis of influenza A viruses predominantly focus on the respiratory tract and related organs (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Kuiken and Taubenberger, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Taubenberger and Morens, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Guarner and Falcon-Escobedo, 2009</xref>). Influenza infections of the respiratory tract can lead to involvement of other organs, however, such as encephalitis and pericarditis (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Edelen et al., 1974</xref>; <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Delorme and Middleton, 1979</xref>; <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Protheroe and Mellor, 1991</xref>; <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">McCullers et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Tamaki et al., 2009</xref>). During the recent influenza H1N1 outbreak, some patients developed severe pancreatitis and multi-organ dysfunction (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Habib et al., 2016</xref>). In mice that were inoculated intranasally with influenza H5N1, the virus was detected in the lungs, heart, blood, kidney, brain, spleen, and liver (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Nishimura et al., 2000</xref>). In addition, highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses were reported to replicate in multiple organs of birds including the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracks (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Kwon et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Prokopyeva et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Epidemiological data suggest that influenza outbreaks inflict higher mortality and morbidity rates on women, especially women of reproductive age, than on men (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Klein et al., 2012</xref>). Furthermore, compared with non-pregnant women, pregnant women have higher rates of hospitalization, admission to intensive care units, severe complications, and death due to influenza infection (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Louie et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Siston et al., 2010</xref>). In the 1918 influenza outbreak, 27% of 1350 pregnant women who were hospitalized due to influenza H1N1 infection died (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Harris, 1919</xref>). In the 2009 influenza H1N1 outbreak in the United States, pregnant women were four-times more likely to be hospitalized because of influenza infection than the general population (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Jamieson et al., 2009</xref>). Altered immune responses are proposed to be the reason for the higher morbidity and mortality of influenza infection in pregnant women (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Klein et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Rasmussen et al., 2012</xref>). Diabetic patients have also been reported to have an increased risk of morbidity and mortality due to influenza A infection (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Ruiz et al., 2018</xref>). Conversely, influenza A infection is believed to increase the risk of type 1 diabetes in genetically susceptible individuals by triggering autoimmunity (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Hyoty, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Op de Beeck and Eizirik, 2016</xref>).</p><p>Respiratory influenza A infections can be lethal in humans. It is unclear whether exposure to influenza viruses through other routes, such as the intramuscular, intradermal, and oral routes, can be equally lethal. Intraperitoneal infection can make the abdominal and pelvic organs accessible to the pathogens because of the circulation of peritoneal fluid throughout the pelvis and abdomen (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Pannu and Oliphant, 2015</xref>). In our previous study, high-dose [1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>8</sup> plaque forming units (pfu)] intraperitoneal infection of mice with influenza A/Hongkong/4801/2014 virus (H3N2) resulted in 50% mortality, whereas low-dose (5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> pfu) intraperitoneal infection with influenza A A/WSN/1933 virus (WSN) induced production of IgG that was cross-reactive to other influenza A viruses, a substantial but transient depletion of B cells and macrophages, and massive neutrophil infiltration of the peritoneal cavity (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Gautam et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>We infected BALB/c mice intraperitoneally with high doses (1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>8</sup> pfu) of WSN and H3N2 and examined the survival of the mice and the pathology and viral titers in the abdominal and pelvic organs and peritoneal fluids. We found that the mice developed severe virus infection in the abdominal and pelvic organs, leading to organ failure and greatly increased expression of chemokines and cytokines in the pancreas, ovary, and uterus. We also determined that low-dose intraperitoneal infection was cross-protective against intraperitoneal or intranasal challenge with a different influenza strain, suggesting low-dose, non-respiratory administration might be feasible as an alternative influenza vaccination. All of the experiments used female mice to focus on the cause of the increased risks associated with influenza A virus infection in female patients. The results presented here provide information about the pathology of influenza A infection in diabetic patients and women.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S2.SS1"><title>Cell Line and Viruses</title><p>Two influenza A viruses, non-mouse-adapted H3N2 and mouse-adapted WSN, were used for intraperitoneal and intranasal infection of BALB/c mice.

Appropriately diluted peritoneal cavity fluids and sera were then transferred to the wells and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. After incubation, the plates were washed and treated with either horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG or goat anti-mouse IgM. IgG subclasses IgG1, IgG2a, IgG2b and IgG3 were detected with respective HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG1/IgG2a/IgG2b/IgG3 antibodies. All HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG or IgM antibodies were purchased from Southern Biotechnology Associates, Inc. (Birmingham, AL, United States).

To understand the effect of influenza A infection on organs that are not considered to be primary targets of the virus, we infected mice intraperitoneally with WSN and/or H3N2. Intraperitoneal infection of mice with influenza A virus exposes the organs of both the abdomen and the pelvis to the virus.</p><p>Turkeys infected intranasally with influenza H7N1 virus and influenza H7N3 virus exhibited histopathological changes in the pancreas, including infiltration by inflammatory cells, necrosis of acinar cells, fibrosis, and ductal hyperplasia (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Capua et al., 2013</xref>). We found that high-dose intraperitoneal infection of mice with H3N2 or WSN resulted in sclerosis of the adipose tissue covering the abdomen in the peritoneal cavity, sclerotic lesions of the pancreas, and massive destruction of the pancreatic structure. Furthermore, we observed apoptosis in pancreatic tissue sections 4 days post infection. It has been reported that influenza A infection induces cell death through apoptosis (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2001</xref>), necrosis (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Mosavi et al., 2015</xref>), and necroptosis (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Sridharan and Upton, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Nogusa et al., 2016</xref>). Influenza A virus induces apoptosis in macrophages, dendritic cells, monocytes, and epithelial cells of the airway and lungs by intrinsic (mitochondrial-dependent) and extrinsic pathways (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Atkin-Smith et al., 2018</xref>). The mitochondrial membrane proteins ANT3 and VDAC1 sense the PB1-F2 protein of the influenza H1N1 virus, triggering cytochrome c release and apoptosis induction (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Zamarin et al., 2005</xref>).

The influenza NS1 protein induces apoptosis via an extrinsic pathway by upregulating FasL (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Schultz-Cherry et al., 2001</xref>). In order to protect the host against influenza A virus, the cytoplasmic protein RIPK3 activates the parallel pathways of FADD-driven apoptosis and MLKL-driven necroptosis (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Nogusa et al., 2016</xref>). Our previous results showed that interaction of the influenza HA protein with &#x003b1;-2,6-linked and &#x003b1;-2,3-linked sialic acids in B cells and macrophages induces apoptosis of those cells in the peritoneal cavity (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Gautam et al., 2019</xref>). Although we detected expression of influenza virus receptors in the pancreas, spleen, ovary, and uterus, influenza A infection only induced apoptosis in pancreatic cells. At early time points after intraperitoneal infection with H3N2 or WSN, we detected virus in the lungs, heart, blood, kidneys, pancreas, spleen, uterus, and ovaries. By contrast, 4 days after initial infection, the viruses were detectable only in the uterus and ovaries. Those results suggest that influenza A viruses that enter the host via the intraperitoneal route can circulate to various abdominal and pelvic organs but only induce apoptosis in pancreatic cells. The mice infected with H3N2 displayed hyperglycemia 4 days post infection, which was probably the result of severe structural damage to the pancreas. A previous study reported similar hyperglycemic conditions in turkeys that were infected intranasally with influenza virus (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Capua et al., 2013</xref>).

It is hard to suppose a direct association between the ovaries and pancreas and the usual route of influenza infection, because intranasal infections do not always result in the spread of the virus to the organs of the abdominal or pelvic cavities. We suggest, however, that peritoneal infection can be used as a model system to explore the higher sensitivity of diabetic patients and women to influenza viruses.</p><p>Influenza A infection is assumed to provoke strong inflammation at the site of infection. Morbidity, pathogenesis, complications, and mortality due to influenza infection are all related to components of the innate immune system that are involved with clearance of the virus. Chemokines and their receptors are key factors in the activation and site-directed migration of leukocytes, which in turn secrete various inflammatory cytokines. Of the proinflammatory cytokines that we tested, IL-6 was the most prominently upregulated both systemically and in the abdominal tissues after intraperitoneal influenza A infection. IL-6 plays a pivotal role in the acute phase of immune responses and regulates innate and adaptive immunity to clear invading pathogens, including influenza viruses (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Dienz et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Tanaka et al., 2014</xref>). Several reports suggest that IL-6 expression is correlated with disease severity following influenza (H1N1) infection (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Hagau et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Paquette et al., 2012</xref>) and that IL-6 plays an essential role in tissue repair during viral infection (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Dienz et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2017</xref>). We found that the extent of IL-6 induction after influenza A infection was much milder in the pancreas, ovary, and uterus compared with that in the spleen. That might explain the higher sensitivity of the pancreas to apoptosis and the slower viral clearance in the ovaries and uterus compared with those in other organs.</p><p>Chemokine expression and recruitment of proinflammatory leukocytes in the infected area are required for viral clearance. In the abdominal organs and blood, the level of the chemokine BLC was dramatically increased after intraperitoneal infection with WSN. BLC, also called CXCL13, is chemotactic for B cells (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Ansel et al., 2002</xref>). The levels of MCP1, also called CCL2, and KC, also called CXCL1, were transiently increased in the pancreas, ovary, and uterus after influenza A infection. MCP1 exhibits chemotactic activity for monocytes and is implicated in autoimmune diseases, including psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis, as well as infectious diseases caused by HIV and influenza virus (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Takahashi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Narasaraju et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Ansari et al., 2011</xref>). KC is produced at high levels during the early phase of influenza infection, resulting in neutrophil recruitment to the affected area (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Tavares et al., 2017</xref>). We observed that intraperitoneal infection with WSN led to robust upregulation of MIG, also called CXCL9, which, unlike MCP1 and KC, remained at a high level in the pancreas and ovaries 4 days after infection. MIG is involved in the polarization of IFN-&#x003b3;-producing type-1 T cells and the activation of inflammatory macrophages (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Zohar et al., 2014</xref>), which suggests that it plays a role in training innate and adaptive immune cells to clear pathogens in the later stages of infection. Therefore, we speculate that in combination with the immediate early responses of MCP1 and KC chemotaxis, the differentiation and activation of immune cells induced by cytokines and chemokines elicit appropriate immunity to influenza virus concurrently with the occurrence of tissue damage in the abdominal organs.</p><p>Intraperitoneal infection provides a direct way to study the pathophysiological changes caused by influenza A infection at non-respiratory sites. Intraperitoneal inoculation with high doses of WSN (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Gautam et al., 2019</xref>) or H3N2 resulted in high titers of anti-viral antibodies in the abdominal and pelvic organs. Furthermore, immunological responses induced by low-dose intraperitoneal infection with one strain of influenza A virus induced an effective defense against future intraperitoneal or intranasal reinfection or challenge with a high dose of another strain of influenza A virus. The protective effect of prior infection was clearly confirmed in the context of survival, viral clearance, and protection of sensitive organs such as the pancreas, ovaries, and uterus. As intraperitoneal infection of low-dose influenza A virus induced production of antibodies cross-reactive to other influenza viruses (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Gautam et al., 2019</xref>), humoral immunity is evidently involved in this protective effect. Considering the large increase of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell population in the peritoneal cavity after low-dose intraperitoneal infection with WSN (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Gautam et al., 2019</xref>), it is likely that cell mediated immunity also contributes to protection. It was previously reported that CD8<sup>+</sup> memory T cells intraperitoneally primed with laboratory-adapted influenza viruses are involved in the protection from respiratory challenge with extremely virulent influenza viruses (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Riberdy et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Christensen et al., 2000</xref>). Involvement of heterologous cell mediated immune response was also reported in avian influenza viruses (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Nfon et al., 2012</xref>). Considering that the mediastinal lymph nodes (MLN) were presumed to be the primary sites of recall response in the intranasal infection of influenza viruses (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Flynn et al., 1998</xref>), there can be some differences in the efficacy of T cell responses upon intranasal challenge depending on the prior infection routes. Although the intraperitoneal route is difficult to apply in human clinics, and high-dose intraperitoneal infection caused organ injury in mice, our results suggest that a trial to find alternative route of vaccination is meaningful to pursue. Intranasal administration of a live-attenuated influenza A virus vaccine, inducing protective immunity and enhancing mucosal immunity (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Bodewes et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Maroof et al., 2014</xref>), is convenient from a practical standpoint. However, the efficacy of this strategy is still controversial (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Caspard et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Gill and Schlaudecker, 2018</xref>). More detailed comparative studies of vaccination by various routes in animals might reveal ways to develop more efficacious and reliable influenza vaccines.</p></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="S5"><title>Data Availability Statement</title><p>All data needed to evaluate the conclusions in the article are present in the article/<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Materials</xref>.
