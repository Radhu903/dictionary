  <p>Apoptosis in abdominal organs following intraperitoneal infection with A/Hong Kong/4801/2014 virus and/or A/WSN/1933 virus. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> BALB/c mice (
   <italic>n</italic> = 5/group) were intraperitoneally infected with 1 × 10
   <sup>8</sup> pfu influenza A/WSN/1933 virus (WSN) or influenza A/Hongkong/4801/2014 virus (H3N2). After 24 h, the mice were sacrificed. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue samples of the pancreas, spleen, ovaries, and uterus were sliced to 5 μm thickness, and immunohistochemical staining was performed to detect cleaved caspase-3. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> BALB/c mice (
   <italic>n</italic> = 10/group) were intraperitoneally infected with PBS or 1 × 10
   <sup>8</sup> pfu WSN or H3N2. After 4 days, the mice were sacrificed. Another group of BALB/c mice (
   <italic>n</italic> = 5/group) were infected intraperitoneally with 5 × 10
   <sup>6</sup> pfu WSN or H3N2. Seven days later, the same mice were challenged with 1 × 10
   <sup>8</sup> pfu of the virus that they were not infected with previously. The mice were sacrificed after 4 days. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue samples of the pancreas, spleen, ovaries, and uterus were sliced to 5 μm thickness, and immunohistochemical staining was performed to detect cleaved caspase-3. Scale bars, 25 μm.
