  <p>Histopathology of organ tissues after high-dose intraperitoneal infection with influenza A/Hong Kong/4801/2014 virus and/or influenza A/WSN/1933 virus. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> BALB/c mice (
   <italic>n</italic> = 5/group) were intraperitoneally infected with 1 × 10
   <sup>8</sup> pfu influenza A/Hongkong/4801/2014 virus (H3N2). After 24 h, the mice were sacrificed, and the abdominal organs were excised. H&amp;E staining was performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections of the pancreas, spleen, ovaries, and uterus. Arrowheads indicate fat globes in the pancreas and disruption of ovarian follicles in the ovaries. Scale bars: left panel 100 μm, right panel 25 μm. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> BALB/c mice (
   <italic>n</italic> = 10/group) were intraperitoneally infected with 1 × 10
   <sup>8</sup> pfu influenza A/WSN/1933 virus (WSN) or H3N2. After 4 days, the surviving mice were sacrificed. Other groups of BALB/c mice (
   <italic>n</italic> = 5/group) were intraperitoneally infected with 5 × 10
   <sup>6</sup> pfu WSN or H3N2. Seven days later, the mice were challenged with 1 × 10
   <sup>8</sup> pfu of the virus that they were not infected with previously. The mice were sacrificed 4 days later. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded 5-μm tissue sections of the pancreas, spleen, ovaries, and uterus were subjected to H&amp;E staining. Arrowheads indicate disruption of ovarian follicles in the ovaries. Scale bars, 25 μm.
