  <p>Antibody production in mice infected intraperitoneally with influenza A/Hongkong/4801/2014 virus and cross-protection against intranasal challenge with influenza A/WSN/1933 virus. 
   <bold>(A–D)</bold> BALB/c mice were infected intraperitoneally with PBS (control) or different doses of A/Hongkong/4801/2014 virus (H3N2; 
   <italic>n</italic> = 5/group except 
   <italic>n</italic> = 10 for 1 × 10
   <sup>8</sup> pfu). Peritoneal cavity supernatants and sera were harvested after 7 days. 
   <bold>(A,B)</bold> Quantities of virus-specific IgG subclasses in the peritoneal cavity 
   <bold>(A)</bold> and sera 
   <bold>(B)</bold> determined by ELISA. 
   <bold>(C,D)</bold> Quantities of virus-specific IgM in the peritoneal cavity 
   <bold>(C)</bold> and sera 
   <bold>(D)</bold> determined by ELISA. 
   <bold>(E,F)</bold> BALB/c mice (
   <italic>n</italic> = 10) were intraperitoneally infected with PBS or 1 × 10
   <sup>8</sup> pfu influenza A/WSN/1933 virus (WSN) and monitored for 7 days. Percentage survival 
   <bold>(E)</bold> and body weight 
   <bold>(F)</bold> for 7 days were measured. 
   <bold>(G,H)</bold> BALB/c mice (
   <italic>n</italic> = 10) were infected intraperitoneally (IP) with 5 × 10
   <sup>6</sup> pfu H3N2. After 7 days, the mice were challenged intranasally (IN) with 1 × 10
   <sup>5</sup> pfu WSN. The survival 
   <bold>(G)</bold> and body weight 
   <bold>(H)</bold> of the mice were recorded for the next 8 days. **
