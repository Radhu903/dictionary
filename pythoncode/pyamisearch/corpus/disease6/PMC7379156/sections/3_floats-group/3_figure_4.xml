  <p>Titers of influenza A/Hong Kong/4801/2014 virus and influenza A/WSN/1933 viruses in peritoneal fluids and organs after high-dose intraperitoneal infection. 
   <bold>(A,C)</bold> BALB/c mice (
   <italic>n</italic> = 15/group) were intraperitoneally infected with 1 × 10
   <sup>8</sup> pfu influenza A/WSN/1933 virus (WSN) or influenza A/Hongkong/4801/2014 virus (H3N2). After 24 h, five mice in each group were sacrificed, and the titers of WSN 
   <bold>(A)</bold> and H3N2 
   <bold>(B)</bold> in the abdominal organs and peritoneal fluids were determined by plaque assay. Four days after the initial infection, five more mice in each group (WSN/4D and H3N2/4D, respectively) were sacrificed, and the viral titers in the abdominal organs and peritoneal fluids were determined by plaque assay 
   <bold>(C)</bold>. 
   <bold>(D)</bold> BALB/c mice were infected intraperitoneally with 5 × 10
   <sup>6</sup> pfu H3N2. Seven days later, the same mice were challenged with 1 × 10
   <sup>8</sup> pfu WSN. Four days after challenge, the mice were sacrificed, and the viral titers in the abdominal organs and peritoneal fluids were determined by plaque assay. ND, no virus detected when the samples corresponding to 100% of the abdominal organs and peritoneal fluids were analyzed.
