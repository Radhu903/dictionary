  <p>Physical condition of the peritoneal cavity and organs after high-dose intraperitoneal infection with influenza A/Hong Kong/4801/2014 virus and/or influenza A/WSN/1933 virus infection. BALB/c mice were intraperitoneally infected with PBS or 1 × 10
   <sup>8</sup> pfu influenza A/WSN/1933 virus (WSN; 
   <italic>n</italic> = 10/group) or influenza A/Hongkong/4801/2014 virus (H3N2; 
   <italic>n</italic> = 10/group). After 4 days, the surviving mice were sacrificed. Other BALB/c mice were intraperitoneally infected with 5 × 10
   <sup>6</sup> pfu WSN or H3N2 (
   <italic>n</italic> = 5/group). After 7 days, the mice were challenged intraperitoneally with 1 × 10
   <sup>8</sup> pfu of the virus that they were not infected with previously. The mice were sacrificed 4 days later.

   <bold>(B)</bold> Organs collected from PBS-treated or virus-infected mice. Right panel shows magnified images of the pancreas. Arrowheads indicate sclerotic lesions.
