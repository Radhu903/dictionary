<p>Eight-week-old BALB/c (H-2
 <sup>b</sup>) mice (Nara Biotech, Inc., Seoul, South Korea) were used for this study. Mice (
 <italic>n</italic> = 5/each group) were infected intraperitoneally or intranasally with H3N2 or WSN at the indicated doses (1 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> to 1 × 10
 <sup>8</sup> pfu per mouse). For challenge experiments, mice (
 <italic>n</italic> = 10/each group) were infected intraperitoneally first with 5 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> pfu of either H3N2 or WSN and then challenged 7 days later with 1 × 10
 <sup>8</sup> pfu of whichever virus they were not infected with initially. The mice were maintained under SPF conditions in a controlled environment (20–25°C, 40–45% humidity, 12-h light/dark cycle; 
 <italic>ad libitum</italic> access to food and water). All experimental procedures were carried out under stringent animal biosafety level 2 (ABL-2) conditions in the Hallym Clinical and Translational Science Institute in accordance with the recommendation of Institutional Biosafety Committee of Hallym University.
