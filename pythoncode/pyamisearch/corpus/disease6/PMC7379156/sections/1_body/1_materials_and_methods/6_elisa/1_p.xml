<p>Eight-week-old BALB/c mice were intraperitoneally infected with 1 × 10
 <sup>6</sup>, 1 × 10
 <sup>7</sup>, 5 × 10
 <sup>7</sup>, or 1 × 10
 <sup>8</sup> pfu H3N2. After 7 days, peritoneal cavity fluids and sera were obtained. Ninety-six-well immunoplates (Nunc
 <sup>TM</sup>, Roskilde, Denmark) were coated with H3N2 (1 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> pfu/well) in carbonate buffer (pH 9.6) and incubated overnight at 4°C. The coated plates were then washed three times with PBST (0.1% tween 20 in PBS). Appropriately diluted peritoneal cavity fluids and sera were then transferred to the wells and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. After incubation, the plates were washed and treated with either horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG or goat anti-mouse IgM. IgG subclasses IgG1, IgG2a, IgG2b and IgG3 were detected with respective HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG1/IgG2a/IgG2b/IgG3 antibodies. All HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG or IgM antibodies were purchased from Southern Biotechnology Associates, Inc. (Birmingham, AL, United States). After incubation for 1 h at room temperature, the plates were washed five times with PBST, and the colorimetric reaction was developed using the substrate 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB; Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD, United States). After optimal color development, the reaction was stopped using a stop solution (Sera Care Life Sciences, Inc. Milford, MA, United States), and the absorbance was measured at 450 nm with a Spectra Max 250 microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, United States).
