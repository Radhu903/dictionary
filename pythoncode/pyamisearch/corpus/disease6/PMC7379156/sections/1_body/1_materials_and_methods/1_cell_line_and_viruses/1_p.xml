<p>Two influenza A viruses, non-mouse-adapted H3N2 and mouse-adapted WSN, were used for intraperitoneal and intranasal infection of BALB/c mice. For production of virus stocks, single-passage viruses were inoculated into the allantoic cavity of 9-day-old specific-pathogen-free (SPF) embryonated chicken eggs. After incubation at 37°C for 48 h, the allantoic cavity fluid was harvested, aliquoted, and stored at −80°C prior to use. The virus was amplified by infecting Madin Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA, United States). MDCK cells (4 × 10
 <sup>6</sup>/dish) were cultivated in 10 cm dishes using Minimum Essential Medium (MEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin (100 U/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) at 37°C in 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> atmosphere. After overnight culture, the cells were washed with PBS and influenza A virus at MOI 0.01 in MEM media containing 1 μg/ml 
 <sc>L</sc>-tosylamide-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK)-treated trypsin was infected into each dish and then incubated at 37°C. After 1 h incubation, the supernatants were removed and then cultured for 72 h in MEM media containing 0.3% BSA. The virus culture supernatants were collected and centrifuged at 2,000 rpm for 10 min at 4°C to remove the cell debris. The quantitation of amplified viruses was performed by plaque assay. The virus preparation and cell culture procedures were performed in biosafety level 2 (BSL-2) conditions.
