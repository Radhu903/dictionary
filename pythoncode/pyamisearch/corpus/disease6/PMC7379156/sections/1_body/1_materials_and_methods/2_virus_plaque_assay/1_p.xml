<p>MDCK cells (7 × 10
 <sup>5</sup>/well) were cultured in 6-well plates overnight. The cells were washed with PBS and infected with the influenza A virus culture supernatants after ten-fold serial dilution. After 1 h incubation at room temperature with shaking applied at 15–20 min intervals, the supernatant was removed by suction. The plates were then overlaid with pre-melted 2 × DMEM/F-12 agar media [2 mM glutamine, 4% BSA, 10 mM HEPES, 2.5% sodium bicarbonate, 50 mg/ml DEAE dextran, 1 μg/ml TPCK-treated trypsin, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 0.6% immunodiffusion-grade agar] and incubated at 37°C for 72 h in 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> atmosphere. Finally, the plates were stained with 0.1% crystal violet and washed after 1 h, and virus titers were determined based on the number of plaques formed (
