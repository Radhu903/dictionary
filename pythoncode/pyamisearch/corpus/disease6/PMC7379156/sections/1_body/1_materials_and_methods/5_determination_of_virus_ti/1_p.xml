<p>Liver, lung, kidney, pancreas, spleen, ovary, and uterus were harvested 24 h or 4 days after intraperitoneal infection. Each tissue was collected in a 2 ml Eppendorf tube (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) containing 1 ml PBS and stainless-steel beads (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and homogenized using Tissue Lyser II (Qiagen). After centrifugation for 5 min at 13,000 rpm, the supernatants were separated and serially diluted by tenfold in PBS. The diluted supernatants were then transferred to six-well plates containing MDCK cell monolayers. The quantitation of the viruses was performed by plaque assay.</p>
