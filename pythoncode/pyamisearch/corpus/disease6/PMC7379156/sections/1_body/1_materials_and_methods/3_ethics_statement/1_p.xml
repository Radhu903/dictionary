<p>Animal experiments were performed in accordance with the recommendations of the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Veterinary Research &amp; Quarantine Service of Korea. All animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Hallym University (Permit Number: Hallym 2017-41, 2018-66, and 2019-25). To minimize pain and suffering, the mice were anesthetized by 1â€“2% isoflurane inhalation (JW Pharmaceutical, Seoul, South Korea). The mice were euthanized by CO
 <sub>2</sub> inhalation if they lost 25% of their baseline adult body weight or if they showed evidence of debilitation, pain or distress, hunched posture, rough hair coat, reduced food consumption, emaciation, inactivity, ambulation difficulty, or respiratory problems. The mice were sacrificed by CO
 <sub>2</sub> inhalation after termination of the experiments.
