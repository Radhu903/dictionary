<p>Chemokine expression and recruitment of proinflammatory leukocytes in the infected area are required for viral clearance. In the abdominal organs and blood, the level of the chemokine BLC was dramatically increased after intraperitoneal infection with WSN. BLC, also called CXCL13, is chemotactic for B cells (

The levels of MCP1, also called CCL2, and KC, also called CXCL1, were transiently increased in the pancreas, ovary, and uterus after influenza A infection. MCP1 exhibits chemotactic activity for monocytes and is implicated in autoimmune diseases, including psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis, as well as infectious diseases caused by HIV and influenza virus (

 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Tavares et al., 2017</xref>). We observed that intraperitoneal infection with WSN led to robust upregulation of MIG, also called CXCL9, which, unlike MCP1 and KC, remained at a high level in the pancreas and ovaries 4 days after infection. MIG is involved in the polarization of IFN-Î³-producing type-1 T cells and the activation of inflammatory macrophages (
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Zohar et al., 2014</xref>), which suggests that it plays a role in training innate and adaptive immune cells to clear pathogens in the later stages of infection. Therefore, we speculate that in combination with the immediate early responses of MCP1 and KC chemotaxis, the differentiation and activation of immune cells induced by cytokines and chemokines elicit appropriate immunity to influenza virus concurrently with the occurrence of tissue damage in the abdominal organs.
