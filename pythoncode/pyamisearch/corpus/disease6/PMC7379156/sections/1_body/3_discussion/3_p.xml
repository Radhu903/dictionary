<p>High-dose intraperitoneal infection with H3N2 or WSN resulted in massive immune-cell infiltration of the uterus 4 days post infection. We also observed disruption of ovarian follicles, although there were no apoptotic signals in the ovaries of the infected mice 4 days post infection. Those results are in line with previous reports that the threat of influenza A infection is increased in women, especially during pregnancy (

It is hard to suppose a direct association between the ovaries and pancreas and the usual route of influenza infection, because intranasal infections do not always result in the spread of the virus to the organs of the abdominal or pelvic cavities. We suggest, however, that peritoneal infection can be used as a model system to explore the higher sensitivity of diabetic patients and women to influenza viruses.
