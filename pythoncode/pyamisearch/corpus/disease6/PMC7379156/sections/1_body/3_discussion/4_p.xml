<p>Influenza A infection is assumed to provoke strong inflammation at the site of infection. Morbidity, pathogenesis, complications, and mortality due to influenza infection are all related to components of the innate immune system that are involved with clearance of the virus. Chemokines and their receptors are key factors in the activation and site-directed migration of leukocytes, which in turn secrete various inflammatory cytokines. Of the proinflammatory cytokines that we tested, IL-6 was the most prominently upregulated both systemically and in the abdominal tissues after intraperitoneal influenza A infection. IL-6 plays a pivotal role in the acute phase of immune responses and regulates innate and adaptive immunity to clear invading pathogens, including influenza viruses (

We found that the extent of IL-6 induction after influenza A infection was much milder in the pancreas, ovary, and uterus compared with that in the spleen. That might explain the higher sensitivity of the pancreas to apoptosis and the slower viral clearance in the ovaries and uterus compared with those in other organs.
