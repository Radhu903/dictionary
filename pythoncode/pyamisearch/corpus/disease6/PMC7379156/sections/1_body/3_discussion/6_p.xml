<p>Intraperitoneal infection provides a direct way to study the pathophysiological changes caused by influenza A infection at non-respiratory sites. Intraperitoneal inoculation with high doses of WSN (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Gautam et al., 2019</xref>) or H3N2 resulted in high titers of anti-viral antibodies in the abdominal and pelvic organs. Furthermore, immunological responses induced by low-dose intraperitoneal infection with one strain of influenza A virus induced an effective defense against future intraperitoneal or intranasal reinfection or challenge with a high dose of another strain of influenza A virus. The protective effect of prior infection was clearly confirmed in the context of survival, viral clearance, and protection of sensitive organs such as the pancreas, ovaries, and uterus. As intraperitoneal infection of low-dose influenza A virus induced production of antibodies cross-reactive to other influenza viruses (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Gautam et al., 2019</xref>), humoral immunity is evidently involved in this protective effect. Considering the large increase of CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cell population in the peritoneal cavity after low-dose intraperitoneal infection with WSN (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Gautam et al., 2019</xref>), it is likely that cell mediated immunity also contributes to protection. It was previously reported that CD8
 <sup>+</sup> memory T cells intraperitoneally primed with laboratory-adapted influenza viruses are involved in the protection from respiratory challenge with extremely virulent influenza viruses (

 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Christensen et al., 2000</xref>). Involvement of heterologous cell mediated immune response was also reported in avian influenza viruses (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Nfon et al., 2012</xref>). Considering that the mediastinal lymph nodes (MLN) were presumed to be the primary sites of recall response in the intranasal infection of influenza viruses (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Flynn et al., 1998</xref>), there can be some differences in the efficacy of T cell responses upon intranasal challenge depending on the prior infection routes. Although the intraperitoneal route is difficult to apply in human clinics, and high-dose intraperitoneal infection caused organ injury in mice, our results suggest that a trial to find alternative route of vaccination is meaningful to pursue. Intranasal administration of a live-attenuated influenza A virus vaccine, inducing protective immunity and enhancing mucosal immunity (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Bodewes et al., 2013</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Maroof et al., 2014</xref>), is convenient from a practical standpoint. However, the efficacy of this strategy is still controversial (

 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Gill and Schlaudecker, 2018</xref>). More detailed comparative studies of vaccination by various routes in animals might reveal ways to develop more efficacious and reliable influenza vaccines.
