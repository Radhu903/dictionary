<p>Respiratory influenza A infections can be lethal in humans. It is unclear whether exposure to influenza viruses through other routes, such as the intramuscular, intradermal, and oral routes, can be equally lethal. Intraperitoneal infection can make the abdominal and pelvic organs accessible to the pathogens because of the circulation of peritoneal fluid throughout the pelvis and abdomen (

 <sup>8</sup> plaque forming units (pfu)] intraperitoneal infection of mice with influenza A/Hongkong/4801/2014 virus (H3N2) resulted in 50% mortality, whereas low-dose (5 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> pfu) intraperitoneal infection with influenza A A/WSN/1933 virus (WSN) induced production of IgG that was cross-reactive to other influenza A viruses, a substantial but transient depletion of B cells and macrophages, and massive neutrophil infiltration of the peritoneal cavity (
