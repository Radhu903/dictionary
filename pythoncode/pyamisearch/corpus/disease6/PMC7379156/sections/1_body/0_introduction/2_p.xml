<p>Epidemiological data suggest that influenza outbreaks inflict higher mortality and morbidity rates on women, especially women of reproductive age, than on men (
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Klein et al., 2012</xref>). Furthermore, compared with non-pregnant women, pregnant women have higher rates of hospitalization, admission to intensive care units, severe complications, and death due to influenza infection (

 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Siston et al., 2010</xref>). In the 1918 influenza outbreak, 27% of 1350 pregnant women who were hospitalized due to influenza H1N1 infection died (
