<p>Immunohistochemistry of paraffin-embedded tissue sections was performed using anti-cleaved caspase-3 antibody to determine if intraperitoneal WSN or H3N2 infection induced apoptosis after 24 h (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>) or 4 days (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>). Mice infected with either virus were positive for cleaved caspase-3 in the pancreas 4 days after infection (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>) but not 24 h after infection (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>); however, they showed no signs of apoptosis in the ovaries or uterus. Mice that were infected intraperitoneally with a low dose of one virus and then challenged intraperitoneally with a high dose of the other virus showed no evidence of apoptosis in the pancreas or spleen 4 days after challenge (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>).
