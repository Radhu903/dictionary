<p>To determine the binding potential of influenza A viruses in the abdominal and pelvic organs, cells were isolated from the pancreas, spleen, ovary, and uterus of uninfected mice and the expression of specific receptors for influenza A virus was analyzed by flow cytometry using SNA (for α-2, 6-Gal sialic acid) and MAL II (for α-2, 3-Gal sialic acid). The cells of all four organs expressed both α-2, 6-Gal and α-2, 3-Gal sialic acid residues (
