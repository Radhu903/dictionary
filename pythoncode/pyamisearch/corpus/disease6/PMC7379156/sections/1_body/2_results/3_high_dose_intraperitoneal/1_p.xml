<p>To determine the histological state of different organs and evaluate possible cause of death induced by high dose viral infection, mice were sacrificed, and different organs were excised 24 h or 4 days after infection. H&amp;E staining of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded pancreas sections taken 24 h after initial infection with influenza H3N2 revealed severe disruption of the acinar glands and islets of Langerhans and the appearance of fat globes (droplets) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). The white pulp of the spleen exhibited erythrocyte leakage caused by disruption of the blood vessels. Compared with those of control mice, the ovaries of the virus-infected mice displayed minimal alterations; however, the uteruses of the virus-infected mice were massively infiltrated with inflammatory cells, in contrast to those of the control mice (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). The mice that were sacrificed 4 days after initial infection with either virus displayed massive infiltration of inflammatory cells in the uterus, disruption of ovarian follicles, and severe disruption of the acinar glands and islets of Langerhans throughout the pancreatic tissue sections (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). In the mice that were challenged after the initial infection, the pancreas showed no prominent abnormalities. Furthermore, the challenged mice showed reduced inflammatory-cell infiltration in the uterus compared with mice that were subjected to a single high-dose infection (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). When we infected mice intraperitoneally with 5 Ã— 10
 <sup>6</sup> pfu influenza A virus as a control, there was no significant changes in the histological state of the different organs in the mice at 7 days after infection (
