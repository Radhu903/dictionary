<p>Intraperitoneal infection of BALB/c mice with a high dose (1 × 10
 <sup>8</sup> pfu) of WSN induced 40% mortality (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1E,F</xref>). In a previous study, intraperitoneal infection of BALB/c mice with a low dose (5 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> pfu) of WSN had a protective effect against subsequent intraperitoneal infection with a high dose (1 × 10
 <sup>8</sup> pfu) of H3N2, a dose that was fatal in previously uninfected mice (

 <sup>6</sup> pfu H3N2 and then infected them intranasally with a potentially lethal dose (1 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> pfu) WSN. The results showed that the low-dose intraperitoneal infection with H3N2 had a protective effect against subsequent lethal-dose intranasal infection with WSN (
