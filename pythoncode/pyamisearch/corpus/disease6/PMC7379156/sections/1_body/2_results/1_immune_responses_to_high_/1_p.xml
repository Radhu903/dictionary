<p>BALB/c mice were intraperitoneally infected with different doses of H3N2 and the virus-reactive antibody production (IgG and IgM) was measured by ELISA 7 days post infection. The levels of influenza H3N2-reactive IgG and IgM increased in the peritoneal cavity fluids and sera in a dose-dependent manner (
