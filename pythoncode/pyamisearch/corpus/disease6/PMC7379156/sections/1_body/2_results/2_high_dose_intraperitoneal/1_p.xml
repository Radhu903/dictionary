<p>Mice were infected intraperitoneally with 1 × 10
 <sup>8</sup> pfu WSN or H3N2 and sacrificed 4 days later to determine the effects of the infection on the abdominal and pelvic organs and tissues. In addition, to investigate the cross-protective effects of influenza A infection, we infected mice intraperitoneally with 5 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> pfu WSN or H3N2 and then challenged them intraperitoneally 7 days later with 1 × 10
 <sup>8</sup> pfu of the virus that they were not exposed to in the initial infection. Four days after challenge, mice were sacrificed, and their abdominal tissues and organs were examined. The mice that were infected with 1 × 10
 <sup>8</sup> pfu of either virus without prior infection displayed sclerosis of the fatty tissue covering the abdomen (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). All of the infected mice had enlarged spleens; however, only the mice that were infected with 1 × 10
 <sup>8</sup> pfu of either virus without prior infection had sclerotic lesions on the pancreas. By contrast, the challenged mice after initial infection, all of which survived until they were sacrificed (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1G</xref>), had no physical abnormalities 4 days after challenge (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2A,B</xref>). When we infected mice intraperitoneally with 5 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> pfu influenza A virus and examined the effects of the infection on the abdominal and pelvic organs and tissues as a control, there was no physical abnormalities observed at 7 days after infection (
