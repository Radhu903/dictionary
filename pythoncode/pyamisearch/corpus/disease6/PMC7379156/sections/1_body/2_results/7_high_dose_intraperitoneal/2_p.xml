<p>Intraperitoneal infection with WSN caused robust upregulation of proinflammatory chemokines in the abdominal tissues, peritoneum, and blood (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>). The most prominent induction was that of B lymphocyte chemoattractant (BLC), which was sustained for 4 days post infection. Similarly, monokine induced by gamma interferon (MIG) was upregulated in the pancreas, ovary, and uterus after WSN infection and remained at a high level in those organs for 4 days after infection. On the other hand, the levels of keratinocyte chemoattractant (KC) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) were increased 24 h post infection but not 4 days post infection (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>). The production of eotaxin was increased after WSN infection in the pancreas and ovaries but not in the blood or peritoneum. The virus-induced expression of RANTES was confined to the ovary and spleen and occurred later than that of the other chemokines (
