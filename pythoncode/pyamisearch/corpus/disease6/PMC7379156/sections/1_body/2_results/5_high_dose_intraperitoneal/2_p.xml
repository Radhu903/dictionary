<p>Because H3N2 induced massive structural damage (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>) and apoptosis (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>) in the pancreas, we asked whether it had any effect on glucose metabolism. We measured the fasting glucose levels in mice infected with influenza H3N2 (5 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> pfu and 1 × 10
 <sup>8</sup> pfu) at the time of initial infection and again 4 days later. We found that the blood glucose levels were markedly increased 4 days after H3N2 infection (1 × 10
 <sup>8</sup> pfu) compared with those at the time of initial infection. In contrast, there was no change in the glucose levels 4 days after 5 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> pfu H3N2 infection (
