<p>To further determine if influenza A virus, infected intraperitoneally, can affect the normal function of organs closely associated with the peritoneal cavity, it is required to examine whether influenza A virus can infect the organs. Therefore, blood, peritoneal cavity fluids, liver, kidney, pancreas, spleen, ovary and uterus were harvested from the mice at 24 h or 4 days after infection with WSN or H3N2 or after initial infection with one of those viruses and subsequent challenge with the other virus. The organs were lysed, and virus titers were measured by plaque assay. All of the organs and fluids harvested 24 h after initial infection yielded viral titers (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4A,B</xref>). In the organs and fluids harvested 4 days after initial infection, there were high viral titers in the ovaries, low titers in the uterus, and no detectable virus titers in the other organs and fluids (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>). To test the possibility that the organs contained very low numbers of virus particles that could potentially replicate in the future, we isolated cells from the organs of uninfected mice and those of mice infected with 5 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> pfu of either virus and then allowed any viruses present in the cells to replicate in a plaque assay. We did not detect any viral amplification in the cells isolated from any of the organs (data not shown). When the mice were infected with 5 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> pfu H3N2 prior to challenge with 1 × 10
 <sup>8</sup> pfu WSN, there were no viral titers in the examined organs 4 days after challenge (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>). In a previous study, we infected mice intraperitoneally with low-dose of virus (5 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> pfu) and could not detect the virus in the spleen, heart, liver, lung, kidney, and peritoneal cavity from the mice when we examined at 5–14 days post-infection (
