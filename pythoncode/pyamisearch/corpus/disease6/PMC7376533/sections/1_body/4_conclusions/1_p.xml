<p id="Par51">We identified HAdV-B55 as the cause of a recent localized ARI outbreak. This incident was the first reported outbreak in Beijing that can be attributed to this re-emergent virus. Our findings show that the risk of an HAdV-B55 epidemic should be paid more attention in Beijing, the capital of China, with a population of more than 20 million. Continuous surveillance of respiratory adenoviruses is an urgent need to understand the epidemiological and evolutionary features of HAdV-B55 and could also find value in an epidemiological modeling approach. We also found that the clinical laboratory data from this outbreak provides important reference for clinical diagnosis and may ultimately aid in informing the development of strategies to control and prevent respiratory tract infections caused by HAdV-B55 .</p>
