 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Adenoviruses are non-enveloped icosahedral particles that contain linear double-stranded DNA genomes with sizes ranging from 26 to 45 kb. Adenovirus genomes are characterized by inverted terminal repeat sequences (ITRs) with sizes ranging from 36 to over 200 bp [
