<p id="Par17">Here we describe an outbreak of ARI caused by HAdV-B55 at a training base in the Daxing District of Beijing, China. To help identify the causative pathogen, we collected pharyngeal swab specimens from the affected students and carried out molecular detection and typing, phylogenic analysis, and whole-genome sequencing. This is the first reported outbreak of ARI in Beijing due to HAdV-B55.</p>
