<p id="Par25">Whole-genome sequencing segments were amplified using high-fidelity polymerase (Takara, Dalian, China) using 1.0 mM of each primer. PCRs were carried out using a BioRad thermocycler (Applied Biosystems, Austin, TX, USA) with the following protocol: 94 °C for 5 min., followed by 35 cycles of 50 s. at 94 °C, 50 s. at appropriate annealing temperature for separate primers, 3 min. at 72 °C, and a final extension step of 72 °C for 10 min.</p>
