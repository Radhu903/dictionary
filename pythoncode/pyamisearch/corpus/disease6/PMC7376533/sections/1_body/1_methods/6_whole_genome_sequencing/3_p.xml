<p id="Par26">The amplified segments were purified and bi-directionally sequenced. Gaps and ambiguous sequences were PCR-amplified using new primers and re-sequenced. DNA sequence fragments were assembled using the SeqMan program implemented in DNASTAR Lasergene 7.0 (DNASTAR, Inc. Madison, WI) into a single contig. The genomic sequence determined in this study was deposited in GenBank under accession number MK886831.</p>
