<p id="Par24">To further analyze mutations in the genome sequences of the viruses isolated in this ARI outbreak, we sequenced the whole genome of one isolate from the index case using the Sanger method. Targeted 1-2 kb segments that covered the entire genome with overlapping sequences of about 200 bp were amplified by PCR. The 5′ and 3′ ITRs of the genome were amplified and cloned into a plasmid T-vector and then sequenced. A set of 47 pairs of primers was designed in-house to amplify the whole genome according to the reference sequence (GenBank accession no. FJ643676) and then used for separate PCRs. Primer sequences are available upon request.</p>
