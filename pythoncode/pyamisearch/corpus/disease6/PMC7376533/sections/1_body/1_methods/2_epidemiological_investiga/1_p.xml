<p id="Par19">On August 26, 2015, one student reported symptoms of an ARI and had a body temperature of 38.4 °C. By August 30, a total of 12 ARI patients from the same class were reported by the local hospital. For the purposes of our analysis, we defined ARI cases as individuals with a body temperature over 38.0 °C and with at least one symptom of a respiratory tract infection, such as cough or sore throat. On August 31, the Daxing District Center for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC) began an epidemiological investigation, collecting demographic, clinical and laboratory data. Under the guidance of the CDC, the training base took precautionary measures, including quarantining the affected students, carrying out a routine cleaning and disinfection of living quarters, and morning body temperature checks. No further new cases were reported by September 08, 2015.</p>
