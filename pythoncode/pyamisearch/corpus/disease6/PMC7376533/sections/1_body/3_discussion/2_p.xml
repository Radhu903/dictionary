<p id="Par41">HAdV-B55 has received additional attention in recent years. HAdV-B55 is a recombinant virus, and it is associated with more severe acute respiratory diseases than other types of HAdVs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. HAdV-B55 was originally described as HAdV-B11a based on earlier putative, sporadic occurrences in Spain (1969) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], Turkey (2004) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], and Singapore (2005) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. HAdV-B55 was also identified as a re-emergent acute respiratory disease pathogen after a recent outbreak in Qishan County, Shaanxi Province, China in 2006 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Subsequent analysis revealed that HAdV-B55 consists of an HAdV-B14 backbone and a partial HAdV-B11 hexon gene. This re-emergent virus exhibited a neutralizing antigen epitope of HAdV-B11 and the pathogenic properties of HAdV-14. Therefore, this virus was renamed HAdV-B55 [
