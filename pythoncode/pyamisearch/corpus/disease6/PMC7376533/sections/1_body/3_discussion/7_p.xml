<p id="Par46">In our study, the strain of BJDX-01-2015 was obtained from the index case (ID#1), who presented with an upper respiratory infection. Furthermore most of the infected students were treated in outpatient clinics, and only one patient with non-severe pneumonia was hospitalized. The isolate of HAdV-B/CHN/BJ01/2011/55 was obtained from a patient with severe CAP in a previous study by Bin Cao et al. at Beijing [

Furthermore, HAdV-B55 was most frequently detected in the 18 cases of adenovirus pneumonia (10/18), and six of the 10 patients ultimately developed acute respiratory distress syndrome. Based on the information of the two cases, two genetic viral samples, and the two independent studies that reported laboratory-confirmed ARIS with HAdV-B55 in Beijing, the isolate of BJDX-01-2015 led to milder ARIs.
