Although the virus spread quickly in the 2015 outbreak reported here, only 12 individuals were infected, including one student who developed pneumonia and was hospitalized. This suggests that the HAdV-B55 strain associated with this outbreak is not as virulent as those reported previously [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], yet the strain should still be considered an urgent public health threat that necessitates measures to contain or control it in order to prevent epidemics.
