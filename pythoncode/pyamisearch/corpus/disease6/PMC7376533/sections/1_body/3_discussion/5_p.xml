<p id="Par44">Unlike other outbreaks caused by HAdVs in the northern regions of China [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] that occurred in the winter or spring, this outbreak in Beijing took place at the end of summer. Studies by Yu J., et al. and Liu T., et al. have reported that, although infections of HAdVs occur throughout the year, HAdV outbreak prevalence often peaks in winter and spring in the north of China and in summer and spring in the south of China [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. It is possible that HAdV outbreaks differ in their seasonality based on relative humidity and temperature. The fact that the HAdV outbreak reported here occurred in summer is thus significant because it could indicate this HAdV-B55 virus strain is capable of circulating in the climate and environmental reservoir.
