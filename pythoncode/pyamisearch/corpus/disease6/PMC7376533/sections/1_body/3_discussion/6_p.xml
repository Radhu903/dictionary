<p id="Par45">The hexon, fiber, and penton genes of virus strain BJDX-01-2015 isolated in this study shared 100% sequence identity with those of the HAdV-B55 strain HAdV-B/CHN/BJ01/2011/55 (GenBank accession number JX491639), which was isolated from a patient with severe CAP in a previous study by Bin Cao et al. at Beijing in 2011 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. The genome of BJDX-01-2015 is most similar to that of HAdV-B/CHN/BJ01/2011/55.
