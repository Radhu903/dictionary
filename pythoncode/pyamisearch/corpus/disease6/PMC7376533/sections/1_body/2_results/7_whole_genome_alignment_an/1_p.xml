<p id="Par38">Comparisons of the whole genome sequence of the BJDX-01-2015 virus strain with other HAdV-B55, HAdV-B11 and HAdV-B14 strains are shown in Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>. The genome of BJDX-01-2015 was 99.97% identical to that of the HAdV-B/CHN/BJ01/2011/55 (GenBank accession number JX491639) strain, having 11 different nucleotides, and 99.89% identical to the strain QS-DLL (GenBank accession number FJ643676), having 38 different nucleotides. BJDX-01-2015 shared 97.62% of its genome with the HAdV-B11 reference strain (GenBank accession number AF532578), and 98.89 and 98.88% of its genome with two HAdV-B14 strains (GenBank accession numbers AY803294 and JX892927; Fig.
