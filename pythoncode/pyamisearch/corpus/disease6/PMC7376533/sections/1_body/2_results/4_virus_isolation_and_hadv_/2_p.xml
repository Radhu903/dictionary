<p id="Par35">The hexon (2841 bp), fiber (978 bp), and penton (1674 bp) sequences from the seven HAdV isolates were 100% identical, suggesting that this outbreak was caused by a single viral strain. We then compared the hexon, fiber, and penton sequences of one of the viral strains isolated from the index case (ID No.1; referred to as BJDX-01-2015), with other HAdV-B55, HAdV-B11 and HAdV-B14 strains. Based on BLAST analysis, the hexon, fiber, and penton genes were 99.6, 100, and 100% identical to the genes of the HAdV-B55 reference strain QS-DLL in China (GenBank accession number FJ643676), respectively,. The hexon, fiber, and penton genes were each 100%, identical to the genes of the isolate HAdV-B/CHN/BJ01/2011/55 (GenBank accession no. JX491639; Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>), which was identified from a single patient in Beijing with severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) who was infected with HAdV-B55. One of the seven strains, BJDX-01-2015, was selected for further whole-genome studies.
