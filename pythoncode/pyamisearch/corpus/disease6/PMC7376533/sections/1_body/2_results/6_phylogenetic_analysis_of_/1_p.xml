<p id="Par37">To investigate the genetic relationships between isolate BJDX-01-2015 and other HAdV strains, we constructed phylogenetic trees (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> (a-d)) using the maximum likelihood method based on the complete hexon, fiber, and penton gene sequences of strain BJDX-01-2015 and other HAdV strains. All phylogenetic trees showed that BJDX-01-2015, associated with this outbreak, clustered with HAdV-B55. The BJDX-01-2015 hexon gene also clustered with HAdV-B11 (GenBank accession number AF532578), while the fiber and penton genes and the full BJDX-01-2015 genome clustered with HAdV-B14 (GenBank accession number AY803294 and JX892927).
