  <p>Based on the complete sequences of (
   <bold>a</bold>) hexon, (
   <bold>b</bold>) fiber, (
   <bold>c</bold>) penton and (
   <bold>d</bold>) complete genome, the maximum likelihood trees were constructed using the Tamura-Nei model (Gamma distributed with Invariant sites (G + I)), the Hasegawa-Kishino-Yano model (Gamma distributed (G)), the Tamura-Nei model (Gamma distributed with Invariant sites (G + I)), the Tamura-Nei model (Gamma distributed with Invariant sites (G + I)), respecitely, with 1000 bootstrap replicates using MEGA 5.0. Bootstrap-supported values greater than 70% are indicated at each node. The scale bar indicates the number of nucleotide substitutions per site. The species of adenovirus is specified in parentheses at the end of the strain information. ●, isolate from this outbreak; ■, HAdV-B/CHN/BJ01/2011/55; ○,QS-DLL strain;▲, HAdV-B11 isolates;▼, HAdV-B14 isolates
