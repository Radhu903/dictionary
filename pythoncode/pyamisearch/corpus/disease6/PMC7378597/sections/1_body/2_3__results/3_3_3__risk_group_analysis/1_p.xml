<p>To analyse modes of transmission, high-risk data associated with HIV 
 <italic>env</italic> and 
 <italic>gag</italic> sequences were also analysed. Only sequences with recorded high-risk information were included in this analysis. Both the 
 <italic>env</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5(a)</xref>) and 
 <italic>gag</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5(b)</xref>) trees showed a predominance of PWID-associated sequences, followed by those linked with heterosexual transmission. Results represented here showed intermixing of PWID and heterosexual routes of transmission, indicating the possibility of bridging of the initial PWID-epidemic into heterosexual populations.
