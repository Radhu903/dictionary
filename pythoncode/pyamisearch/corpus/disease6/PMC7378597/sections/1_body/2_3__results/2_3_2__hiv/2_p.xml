<p>The second tree was constructed with HIV 
 <italic>gag</italic> sequences from 8 FSU countries spanning the years 1997–2013 as follows: Belarus (1997–2013), Georgia 1999 (1999), Kazakhstan (2002), Latvia (1998–2005), Russia (1997–2011), Ukraine (2000–2012), and Uzbekistan (2002). The majority of 
 <italic>gag</italic> sequences were from Russia and Latvia, whereas only one sequence was from Georgia. Twelve clusters were picked from the tree for the further analysis (
 <xref rid="tab4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>): cluster A (10 sequences, representing 1 countries), cluster B (13 sequences, representing 3 countries), cluster C (9 sequences, representing 4 countries), cluster D (7 sequences, representing 3 countries), cluster E (6 sequences, representing 4 countries), cluster F (17 sequences, representing 1 countries), cluster G (33 sequences, representing 4 countries), cluster H (13 sequences, representing 1 countries), cluster I (12 sequences, representing 2 countries), cluster J (20 sequences, representing 3 countries), cluster K (31 sequences, representing 1 countries), and cluster L (7 sequences, representing 3 countries). This tree clearly showed intermixing of Russian strains with Latvia (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). In agreement with the observations from the HIV 
 <italic>env</italic> tree (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), in this tree as well, sequences from Russia and Latvia were intermixed in almost all the clusters throughout the tree (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and 
 <xref rid="tab4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). Additionally, as was observed in the 
 <italic>env</italic> tree, the ancestral sequences, representing the earliest infections, in this tree as well originated from Ukraine, with some intermixing of sequences from Russia (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>). Both in the 
 <italic>env</italic> (cluster F) and 
 <italic>gag</italic> (clusters A, F, H and K) trees, monophyletic clusters of Latvian sequences originating from Russian sequences were observed (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>), possibly indicating epidemics in Latvia that resulted from migrant-associated transmissions from Russia.
