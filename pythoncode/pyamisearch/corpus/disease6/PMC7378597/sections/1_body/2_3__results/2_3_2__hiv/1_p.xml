<p>A phylogenetic tree was constructed with 
 <italic>env</italic> sequences from 10 counties, spanning years 1993–2015, as follows: Armenia (2009), Belarus (1997–2015), Georgia (1997–2013), Estonia (2001–2005), Kyrgyzstan (2009), Latvia (1998–2005), Moldova (1997), Russia (1994–2015), Ukraine (1993–2012), and Uzbekistan (1999–2002). In addition, 12 nonsubtype A references were retrieved from the database and were used as outliers to root the phylogenetic tree. Fifteen clusters were picked from the tree for further analysis (
 <xref rid="tab3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>): cluster A (76 sequences, representing 5 countries), cluster B (53 sequences, representing 4 countries), cluster C (25 sequences, representing 2 countries), cluster D (83 sequences, representing 6 countries), cluster E (13 sequences, representing 3 countries), cluster F (111 sequences, representing 4 countries), cluster G (143 sequences, representing 5 countries), cluster H (8 sequences, representing 4 countries), cluster I (17 sequences, representing 5 countries), cluster J (55 sequences, representing 4 countries), cluster K (130 sequences, representing 4 countries), cluster L (16 sequences, representing 2 countries), cluster M (84 sequences, representing 5 countries), cluster N (16 sequences, representing 3 countries), and cluster O (6 sequences, representing 1 countries). More than half of the sequences used to construct the tree were from Russia; therefore, the results show a predominance of Russian branches in most clusters (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and 
 <xref rid="tab3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Interestingly, sequences from Russia, Uzbekistan, and Latvia were intermixed in almost all the clusters, whereas sequences from Armenia were also represented prominently in most clusters (

 <xref rid="tab3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>).
