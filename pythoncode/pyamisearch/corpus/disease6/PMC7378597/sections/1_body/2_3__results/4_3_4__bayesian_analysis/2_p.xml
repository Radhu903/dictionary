<p>We further investigated the past population dynamics of HCV and HIV using a Bayesian skyline plot, which depicts the changes in effective population size over time. The effective population size of HCV 1b was observed to be fluctuating and slowly rising from 1998 to 2011. The change in effective population size for HCV 3a rose slowly and steadily starting in 1965, characterized by a phase of exponential growth (1981–1997), and the effective population size surged approximately 100-fold during the period. The epidemic history of HIV 
 <italic>env</italic> and HIV 
 <italic>gag</italic> seems to have experienced complex dynamics, characterized by two phases of wave-like fluctuating growth, during 1997–2005 and 2009–2014 for HIV 
 <italic>env</italic>, and during 1995–2005 and 2009–2015 for HIV 
 <italic>gag</italic> (
