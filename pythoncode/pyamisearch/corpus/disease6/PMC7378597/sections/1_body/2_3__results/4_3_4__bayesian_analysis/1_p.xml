<p>As summarized in 
 <xref rid="tab5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>, our Bayesian phylogenetic analysis showed substitution rate for NS5B HCV 1b and HCV 3a to be 6.8 (5.8–7.9) × 10
 <sup>−3</sup> and 1.1 (0.7–1.4) × 10
 <sup>−3</sup> substitutions per site per year, respectively, with a SkyGrid coalescent model, whereas the estimated tMRCAs for HCV 1b and HCV 3a were 1977 (95% highest posterior density, HPD: 1962–1985) and 1965 (95% HPD: 1941–1978), respectively. The estimated evolutionary rates of HIV 
 <italic>env</italic> and HIV 
 <italic>gag</italic> were 3.5 (2.5–4.0) × 10
 <sup>−2</sup> and 13 (8.8–17) × 10
 <sup>−3</sup> substitutions per site per year, respectively. The likely years of origins of HIV 
 <italic>env</italic> and 
 <italic>gag</italic> were estimated to be 1992 (95% HPD: 1990–1993) and 1996 (95% HPD: 1995–1997), respectively.
