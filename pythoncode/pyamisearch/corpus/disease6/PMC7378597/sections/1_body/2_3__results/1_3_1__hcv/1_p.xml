<p>The maximum likelihood trees generated using genotype 1b or 3a NS5B sequences from 7 countries revealed phylogenetic links of Russian clusters with sequences from other FSU countries. The sequences analysed were deposited during 1995–2015 (Tables 
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Overall, 10 clusters were picked from HCV 1b NS5B tree based on the predominance of sequences from a particular country or risk group (

Genotype 1b tree showed intermixing of Russian sequences mainly with those from Estonia (clusters A, B, and D–J), Lithuania (clusters B-J), Azerbaijan (clusters A-E, G, and I), Uzbekistan (clusters A-G and I), and Tajikistan (clusters A, B, D–F, and H–J) (

Genotype 3a tree showed a similar trend with an intermixing of HCV sequences from Russia mainly with those from Estonia (clusters A and C–G), Uzbekistan (clusters A, C, and E–G), and Azerbaijan (clusters A, B, D, F, and G) (
