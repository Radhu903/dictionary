<p>Such phylogenetic patterns may be supported by historical and socioeconomic factors that came into play after the disintegration of the Soviet Union. It has been established that the first nationalism-related conflicts between Armenia and Azerbaijan (1987–1991), followed by Uzbekistan conflict (1989), and civil wars in Georgia (1991–1993) and Tajikistan (1992–1997) led to mass migration from these countries to Russia [

 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Our Bayesian analysis predicts origin of the HCV epidemics in FSU countries to be as early as 1965, for HCV3a, and 1977, for genotype 1b (
 <xref rid="tab5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), indicating that these HCV genotypes were possibly circulating in the region before the conflicts started. It is possible that HCV was transmitted during this time through injection use, leading to a rise in transmission in the mid-1990s, as suggested by our Skyline plot analysis (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). In addition, significant reduction of employment opportunities and a dramatic decline in wages in Tajikistan and Georgia also facilitated a high flow of migrant labor into Russia. Further movement involved repatriates and internally displaced people of Russian-speaking origin into Russia owing to a resurgence of nationalism as a result of implementation of national language policies that discouraged use of Russian. It is thought that the reported numbers of migrants in this region is much lower than the actual numbers, since visa-free movement across borders does not account for illegally entering migrant workers [
