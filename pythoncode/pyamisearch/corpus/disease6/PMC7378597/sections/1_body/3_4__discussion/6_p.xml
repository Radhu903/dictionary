<p>The HIV epidemic expanded rapidly after the collapse of the USSR. As noted previously, political transitions led to the socioeconomic decline of newly formed independent counties. Consequently, large-scale labor migration to Russia from other countries of FSU provided epidemiological bridging of HIV transmission between Russia and the rest of FSU countries [
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The database of international migration demonstrated a significant increase in migration between 1991 and 2000 within the FSU. The number of migrants from Central Asia, Caucasus, and Eastern Europe to Russia was highest from 1992 to 1996 [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref> and Tables 
 <xref rid="tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref> and 
 <xref rid="tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>), which might suggest a link to migrant-associated HIV transmission. The HIV epidemic in FSU is considered to have initiated by transmissions through sexual contact and injection drug use [
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Our results of phylogenetic tree in the context of high-risk behavior (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5(a)</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5(b)</xref>) support that fact, showing the branches close to the ancestral node associated with heterosexual mode of transmission, with sequences represented from Uzbekistan (1999), Ukraine (1993), and Russia (1994).
