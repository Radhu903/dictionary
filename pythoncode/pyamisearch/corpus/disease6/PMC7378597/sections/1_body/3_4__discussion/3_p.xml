<p>In our phylogenetic tree constructed with HCV 1b sequences (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), a preponderance of Russian sequences was seenâ€”a reflection of a higher representation of sequences from this country in the Los Alamos database. Russian sequences were intermixed with clusters from most other FSU countries, with a relatively higher proportion from Lithuania and Estonia. This might reflect a higher transmigration between Russia, Lithuania, and Estonia, due to their close geographic proximity. Conversely, in clusters C, D, and F, sequences from Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan were seen intermixed with those from Russia, indicating that Russia might have served as a hub for transmission across these countries. Phylogenetic tree constructed with HCV 3a NS5B sequences (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) showed an overall agreement with the 1b tree, showing trends of possible transmission within Russia, Lithuania, Uzbekistan, Estonia, and Azerbaijan.
