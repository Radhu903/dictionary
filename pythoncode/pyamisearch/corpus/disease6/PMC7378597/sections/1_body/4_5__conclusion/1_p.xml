<p>Our analyses highlight the main routes of transmission for two important blood-borne viruses in FSU countries. This information may be exploited to refine Public Health policies to better manage the infected populations and prevent further spread of the infections. Although this study was limited by the availability of the number of sequences from FSU countries in the open-access databases, the results highlight the importance of focusing the harm reduction efforts on communities where blood-borne infections might be currently spreading, namely, persons who inject drugs, heterosexual populations, migrant workers, and cross-border travelers.</p>
