<p>To investigate temporal signal in the data set, we used the maximum-likelihood tree for the analysis of correlation between root-to-tip genetic distance and year of sampling in the program 
 <italic>TempEst v1.5.</italic> A Bayesian phylogenetic approach [
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] was used for joint estimation of the ages of each of clusters and the demographic history of all of the strains. This was done by analyzing these sequences using the general time reversible (GTR) model [
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] plus a gamma distribution among site rate heterogeneities [
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] on the basis of the standard Akaike information criterion in a hierarchical likelihood ratio test in our study. Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analyses were performed with the selected nucleotide substitution model using an uncorrelated lognormal relaxed-clock model [
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] as implemented in 
 <italic>BEAST, version 1.8.4.</italic> The analyses were performed using a Bayesian SkyGrid coalescent tree prior [
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] in order to investigate the demographic histories of HCV or HIV and the degree to which dating estimates are affected by the demographic model chosen. Sequences for which sampling year information was unavailable were excluded from the analysis.
