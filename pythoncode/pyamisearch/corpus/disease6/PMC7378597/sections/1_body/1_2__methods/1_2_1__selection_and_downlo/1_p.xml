<p>For HCV, a 234 bp fragment of NS5B gene (corresponding to H77 8322–8555 nt) was studied. We downloaded 614 sequences for genotype 1b and 295 for genotype 3a from the Los Alamos HCV database (

Sequences from 9 FSU countries, namely, Russia, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, and Georgia, were used for this analysis. Sequence retrieval and length decisions were based on selecting the most represented gene fragment (and genotype sequences) available for most FSU countries in the said database (Supplementary

For constructing phylogenetic tress, 10 known genotype sequences were used as reference.
