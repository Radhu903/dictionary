<p>To ensure convergence of parameter estimates, the MCMC was run for 100 million steps and sampled every 10000 steps. The resulting MCMC samples under different demographic models were used to estimate the rates of evolution and tMRCAs with the first 10% removed as burn-in. Convergence of parameters and sufficient sampling were assessed by calculating the effective sample size (ESS) using TRACER v1.6 (

A final maximum clade credibility (MCC) tree was constructed from the posterior tree distribution using the program Tree Annotator (
