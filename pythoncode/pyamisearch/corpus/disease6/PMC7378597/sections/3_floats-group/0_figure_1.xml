  <p>Phylogenetic relationship of HCV genotype 1b NS5B sequences from FSU countries: For the construction of the phylogenetic tree, a stretch of HCV sequence corresponding to H77 nucleotide 8322â€“8555 was used. The sequences are included from Azerbaijan, Georgia, Estonia, Lithuania, Russia, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan, represented by, respectively, orange, purple, pink, brown, dark blue, coral, and turquoise branches. The branches coded grey represent 10 outgroup reference sequences that were used to root the tree.</p>
