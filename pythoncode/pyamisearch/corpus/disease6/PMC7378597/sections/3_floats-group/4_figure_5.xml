  <p>Analysis of HIV transmission routes in FSU countries: HIV-1 subtype A 
   <italic>env</italic> (a) or 
   <italic>gag</italic> (b) sequences from FSU countries were analysed for high-risk behavior. To analyse risk behavior in the context of location, the two versions of the same tree, with branches color-coded for the country of origin (left) or the associated risk group (right), are juxtaposed. Only sequences with recorded high-risk labels were included in this analysis. Risk behavior information for each sequence was obtained from HIV Los Alamos Database. For the tree on the right, the colors dark blue, teal, turquoise, pink, green, olive, red, neon, orange, and grey branches indicate, respectively, heterosexual, sexual transmission (unspecified type), MSM, mother-to-child, PWID, blood transfusion, homosexual, sex worker, bisexual, and reference sequences. For the tree on the left, the color key is the same as for
