  <p>Phylogenetic relationship of HIV subtype A 
   <italic>env</italic> gene sequences from FSU countries: For the construction of the phylogenetic tress, a stretch of HIV sequence corresponding to HBX2 nucleotide 7071â€“7336 was used. The sequences are included from Armenia, Belarus, Georgia, Estonia, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Moldova, Russia, Ukraine and Uzbekistan represented by, respectively, teal, green, purple, pink, neon, yellow, olive, dark blue, red, and turquoise branches. The branches coded grey represent 12 outgroup reference sequences that were used to root the tree.
