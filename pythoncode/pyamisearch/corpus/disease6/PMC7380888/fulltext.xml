pathways. The presence of serum antibody against arboviruses in vertebrates provides evidence of their historical exposure but reveals nothing about the vector-reservoir relationship. Moreover, collecting blood or tissue samples from vertebrate hosts is ethically and logistically challenging. We developed a novel approach for screening the immune status of vertebrates against Ross River virus that allows us to implicate the vectors that form the transmission pathways for this commonly notified Australian arboviral disease.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><p>A micro-plaque reduction neutralisation test (micro-PRNT) was developed and validated on koala (<italic>Phascolarctos cinereus)</italic> sera against a standard PRNT.

Blood meals from mosquitoes fed on sheep blood supplemented with RRV antibodies, and on blood from RRV seropositive humans neutralised the virus by &#x02265;50% until 48 hr post feeding.

In recent decades, rapid urbanization and population growth have assisted the expansion of several viruses from having localised, rural, transmission cycles to being worldwide and urban problems [<xref rid="pone.0229314.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Epidemiological cycles of many arboviruses, such as Ross River (RRV) and West Nile (WNV) incorporate complex transmission networks involving multiple vertebrate hosts and many vectors. Humans are not necessarily key components of these transmission networks, but increasing human travel, trade and deforestation bring humans into contact with sylvatic/enzootic cycles. This can stimulate arbovirus emergence, re-emergence and spillover into human populations [<xref rid="pone.0229314.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0229314.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>A comprehensive knowledge of the transmission pathways of arboviruses is needed to effectively manage and respond to their emergence. Surveillance systems are needed to identify which mosquito species are responsible for transmission and which animals are acting as amplifying or reservoir hosts. However, the identification of amplifying hosts and transmission pathways remains extremely challenging.</p><p>More than 75 arboviruses have been identified in Australia and a small number are associated with human infection [<xref rid="pone.0229314.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Of these, RRV [<xref rid="pone.0229314.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], Barmah Forest virus [<xref rid="pone.0229314.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], WNV strain Kunjin [<xref rid="pone.0229314.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], and the potentially fatal Murray Valley encephalitis virus [<xref rid="pone.0229314.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] are of the greatest public health concern. RRV is the most commonly notified arboviral disease but multiple vectors and many potential vertebrate hosts make this a complex zoonosis. There is little empirical evidence regarding its key transmission cycles or the factors that encourage their spillover to the human population [<xref rid="pone.0229314.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0229314.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>One means of identifying likely vertebrate disease reservoirs is to demonstrate their historical exposure to disease by searching for virus-specific antibodies in animal sera or tissues. Development of antibody is the major immune response to infection with parasites and pathogens including arboviruses [<xref rid="pone.0229314.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0229314.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. While such serological evidence of infection does not prove that an animal is an amplifying host or key reservoir, it does allow the generation of hypotheses about probable pathways and is especially useful when combined with information on mosquito species and their host preference. Serological surveys of blood meals are likely to be more fruitful than the direct identification of viruses because vertebrates are only viraemic for a few days, only a small proportion of mosquitoes are virus positive and there is a diminishingly small probability that a captured mosquito will be carrying a virus positive mosquito blood meal. A tremendous sampling effort is therefore required to incriminate reservoir and vector pathways by virus isolation alone.</p><p>The potential for screening mosquito blood meals for antibodies to dengue, Japanese encephalitis [<xref rid="pone.0229314.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], and WNV [<xref rid="pone.0229314.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] has been investigated previously but existing studies required the use of host-specific conjugated antibodies. This is of little utility for the investigation of complex zoonoses like RRV where the hosts are myriad or unknown. The &#x0201c;gold standard&#x0201d; of serological tests is the Plaque Reduction Neutralisation Test (PRNT) [<xref rid="pone.0229314.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. It does not need prior knowledge of host origin but typically requires large quantities of sera or tissue; substantially larger than a typical mosquito blood meal (estimated to be 3 &#x003bc;l [<xref rid="pone.0229314.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0229314.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]).</p><p>We developed a micro-PRNT [<xref rid="pone.0229314.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0229314.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] to suit small sample volumes. In this alternative approach, we exploit the fact that vertebrate antibodies persist within mosquito blood meals for some time after the mosquito has fed on a seropositive host. We demonstrate that a micro-PRNT technique can identify vertebrate RRV antibodies in small volumes of sera and mosquito blood meals. This has utility as part of an integrated xenodiagnostic approach that exploits the capture of single blood-fed mosquitoes to infer mosquito species, host preference and host exposure to disease. This will help prioritise potential transmission pathways for further study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec007"><title>Cells and virus</title><p>Vero cells (WHO vaccine strain) and the RRV strain T-48 [<xref rid="pone.0229314.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] were obtained from the WHO Collaborating Centre for Arbovirus Reference and Research at the Queensland University of Technology (QUT).

This study demonstrates that a micro-PRNT using 96-well plates has considerable utility for characterizing the antibody content of small blood volumes and is equivalent in sensitivity and specificity to the &#x0201c;gold standard&#x0201d; conventional PRNT method. In conjunction with the species identification of the blood-fed mosquito, and the use of existing molecular tools to identify the host origin of the blood meal, this new diagnostic has the capacity to increase our understanding of the key pathways for the transmission of complex zoonotic arboviruses.</p><p>The accuracy of the micro-PRNT for testing RRV antibodies in this study compared favourably with a conventional PRNT method when applied to our koala samples. Similarly, confluent results were reported for a micro-PRNT tested against yellow fever virus in artificially spiked serum samples [<xref rid="pone.0229314.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Although alternatives to the PRNT such as a VecTest-inhibition assay and a biotin microsphere immunoassay have been used to identify pathogen-specific antibodies in mosquito blood meals [<xref rid="pone.0229314.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]; both require host-specific antibodies and the latter demands considerable laboratory resources. Our micro-PRNT demonstrates sufficient sensitivity, specificity and utility for the determination of RRV antibodies in blood-fed mosquitoes that have fed on any vertebrate.</p><p>Our micro-PRNT could detect &#x02265;50% RRV neutralisation by mosquito blood meals up to 36&#x02013;48 hr post blood-feeding. Although this is the first study to have identified RRV antibodies in mosquito blood meals, more general studies have shown that antibodies can survive in those environments. Hatfield (1988) identified Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) specific antibodies using antibody-captured ELISA from the hemolymph of <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> up to 48 hr after feeding [<xref rid="pone.0229314.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Irby and Apperson (1989) used an immunoblot technique to demonstrate that serum proteins from rodents and humans persisted in <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> blood meals for 36 to 48 hr post-feeding [<xref rid="pone.0229314.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Anti-BSA antibodies were detected 9 days after blood feeding in <italic>Anopheles stephensi</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0229314.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and human specific IgM and IgG were present in the blood meals of <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>albopictus</italic> for 7 days [<xref rid="pone.0229314.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. These extended periods are surprising given that one would expect blood meals and their proteins to have been fully digested by then but the persistence of antibodies in mosquito blood meals will differ with species, ambient temperature, body size, initial concentration of antibodies, blood meal volume and the length of the gonotrophic cycle. In our study, the period of detectability (48&#x02013;60 hr) corresponded to the period that blood was externally visible in the abdomen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0229314.g001">Fig 1</xref>).</p><p>The small volumes of homogenate left from a single mosquito after execution of the micro-PRNT allows for a parallel PCR amplification for identification of the blood meal source (the host). The literature commonly reports that the origin of host blood meals can be identified from as a little as 0.02 &#x003bc;l of blood [<xref rid="pone.0229314.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In our proof of principle, 10 &#x003bc;l aliquots of 1:20 diluted homogenate recovered from the micro-PRNT 60 hr post blood-feeding were successfully amplified and sequenced to identify our experimental donors: sheep and humans.</p><p>Given the challenges involved in obtaining, trapping and screening wild animals for serum sampling and sero-prevalence studies [<xref rid="pone.0229314.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], the collection of blood fed mosquitoes is a useful means of sampling, with mosquitoes acting as an indirect sampling tool or &#x0201c;flying syringe&#x0201d; for sampling inaccessible or ethically challenging hosts. In terms of pathway incrimination, a single mosquito will yield information on vectors, host preference and the disease exposure of that host [<xref rid="pone.0229314.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. That information, especially when combined with risk modelling [<xref rid="pone.0229314.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] can be used to identify those transmission pathways of greatest importance within the host community. Various studies have observed the potential for insect blood meals to detect pathogen specific antibodies [<xref rid="pone.0229314.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0229314.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0229314.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], but none have developed high throughput methods suitable for application to transmission ecologies involving unknown reservoirs.</p><p>Human health can be affected by infectious diseases of wildlife living close to human habitation. The risks are increasingly common in Australia and elsewhere because of increasing encroachment of the human population on diverse mosquito habitats and the adaptation of pathogen reservoir species to urbanized environments [<xref rid="pone.0229314.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0229314.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Dengue, Hantavirus, Lyme disease, Zika, avian influenza, and rabies are examples of globally endemic zoonoses that have emerged from human encroachment into rural or sylvatic habitats [<xref rid="pone.0229314.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0229314.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Similarly, RRV is a major public health risk in Australia, maintained in a diverse range of hosts and vectors and undergoing an expansion in range to the Pacific Islands [<xref rid="pone.0229314.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].</p><p>Infectious diseases are also a concern for wildlife conservation, particularly those already threatened by habitat loss and exploitation. Surveillance of wild animals for infection or disease commonly involves trapping or killing animals for direct sampling of blood and tissues. This can be difficult, expensive, dangerous and sometime unethical. The technique demonstrated here is not only applicable to RRV reservoir identification but also to other arboviruses and infectious agents which have complex transmission cycles and a range of vertebrate hosts.</p><p>There was a &#x02248;10% inhibition of virus pfu by mosquito tissue homogenates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0229314.g003">Fig 3</xref>). However, this inhibition was minimal compared to the threshold used to determine positive neutralisation (&#x0003e;50% reduction). One possible explanation of this observation is that some component of abdominal tissue may have an inhibitory effect on virus replication.</p><p>As for all serum or tissue collection techniques, reliance on blood-fed mosquitoes as a sampling tool will be subject to sampling bias. Mosquitoes may be differentially attracted to diseased hosts [<xref rid="pone.0229314.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] or to species that are uncharacteristically abundant at any single point in time. Different mosquito trapping techniques have differential vector specific targets, so using one particular trap type might miss key vector species. In terms of serology, there may be considerable cross reaction between some virus antibodies [<xref rid="pone.0229314.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In this case RRV is likely to cross-react with the closely related alphavirus, Barmah Forest virus, whose epidemiology in Queensland remains significant [<xref rid="pone.0229314.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Finally, those reservoirs inferred by blood meal analysis may not be the key amplifying host, and the mosquitoes incriminated may not be the key vector. For example, dengue antibodies are commonly found in <italic>Culex</italic> spp. mosquitoes during epidemics, but those mosquitoes do not transmit the disease. Nonetheless their blood meals may still identify the host and its sero-prevalence rate [<xref rid="pone.0229314.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. For all of these reasons, the various components of the pathways implicated by the micro-PRNT technique and attendant host identifications must be interpreted and prioritised in the light of all the available knowledge on the ecology of the disease.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec020"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The value of the micro-PRNT lies in its ability to detect anti-virus antibodies from mosquito blood meals obtained from any vertebrate host. When coupled with molecular identification of the host by DNA amplification and sequencing, valuable information on vector-host relationships, wildlife sero-prevalence rates and zoonotic transmission cycles can be inferred [<xref rid="pone.0229314.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. This novel xenodiagnostic offers an alternative &#x0201c;flying syringe&#x0201d; approach for serum sampling and for monitoring sero-prevalence in animals. The use of this assay to characterise the blood meals of mosquitoes collected from the field in Brisbane is now underway.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Prof. John Aaskov and Dr. Francesca Frentiu from QUT for their advice and for the supply of Vero cells and the RRV isolate.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0229314.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Gould</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Pettersson</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Higgs</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Charrel</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name>, <name><surname>de Lamballerie</surname><given-names>X</given-names></name>. <article-title>Emerging arboviruses: Why today?</article-title>. <source><italic toggle="yes">One Health</italic></source>. <year>2017</year>;<volume>4</volume>:<fpage>1</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>13</lpage>. <pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1016/j.onehlt.2017.06.001</pub-id>

</p><p>Manuscript ID PONE-D-20-02979 Response to Reviewers</p><p>Title: A micro-PRNT for the detection of Ross River virus antibodies in mosquito blood meals: a useful tool for inferring transmission pathways.</p><p>Comments to the Editor</p><p>We have amended the ethics statements according to your instructions. Written consent was required by volunteers. That information is now included in the last paragraph of the section &#x0201c;Preparation of blood fed mosquitoes&#x0201d;.</p><p>We have made a number of changes to the text, additional to the requests may by the reviewers. These are visible in the track changed R1 manuscript. There have been no changes in context, methodology or interpretation but we have altered sections of text for clarity or to correct grammar. The major changes are detailed below:</p><p>1. Introduction: We have moved two paragraphs form the end of the introduction to further up the page.</p><p>2. Preparation of blood fed mosquitoes: First and last paragraphs revised for methodological clarity and to include requested information on ethics. </p><p>3. Validation of the micro PRNT: We have clarified some of information on blood meal volumes.</p><p>4. The text in the discussion has been improved for flow and clarity, but the interpretation of results has not changed. </p><p>Response to Reviewers</p><p>Reviewer #1</p><p>Comment 1: Interesting technical paper with only minor edits.</p><p>Line 70 use of word "encourage" needs to be re-examined</p><p>Line 91 West Nile viruses</p><p>Lines 233 and 241 missing period.</p><p>Line 302 sometimes</p><p>Response: We thank the reviewer for their positive assessment of the study and for identifying these minor edits. These have been corrected in the updated manuscript.</p><p>Comment 2: Overall - I am not sure how useful some of the figures are. Figure 1 needs T=0 or state it was fully engorged - even with this I am not sure it really adds anything.</p><p>Figure 4 B and C - so small hard to see better to summarize data and leave the plates out?</p><p>Response: We feel that Fig 1 is a useful visual representation of the amount of blood present at various times post feeding. We have updated Fig 1 to include 0 (fully engorged) and 6h post feeding. </p><p>For Fig 4, we agree with the reviewer. We have removed the photos of the micro-titre plates, leaving only the line graph to demonstrate the relationship between antibody concentration and plaque inhibition over time.</p><p>Reviewer #2</p><p>Comment 1: The work proposes the use of micro PRNT from blood present in mosquito abdomens, useful tool for viral ecology projects, standardized in that study for Ross River virus. Very important and well-designed work.</p><p>Line 96 &#x02013; What is "ca"? Appears on line 305 again.</p><p>Line 107 &#x02013; The reagent "L-glutamine (200 mM)" is repeated in the formulation. I believe it must be an antimicrobial, perhaps Gentamicin.</p><p>Lines 171 &#x02013; 172 &#x0201c;The volume of RPMI 1640 was adjusted to obtain a 20-fold dilution of the blood.&#x0201d; What level of volume control is there in this process? Is the blood volume measured? That part was not clear.</p><p>Lines 180 &#x02013; 181 &#x0201c;Aedes notoscriptus that had been fed on human seropositive or seronegative volunteers&#x0201d; Mention the quality control that is done on these mosquitoes, as they were used to feed on human volunteers.</p><p>The legends of figures 1, 2 and 3 are incomplete. In all of them the information needs to be complemented.</p><p>Response: We thank the reviewer for their positive assessment of the study. </p><p>&#x0201c;ca&#x0201d; (Circa) has been replaced with &#x0201c;approximately&#x0201d;. </p><p>We have removed reference to L-glutamine which is an amino acid and a common additive to cell culture media.</p><p>We used fully engorged mosquitoes, published estimates of mean blood volumes (e.g Konishi 1989, Jeffery 1956) and applied dilution factors to those published estimates. </p><p>All mosquitoes were from established, uninfected colonies. The sero-status of human volunteers was confirmed by standard PRNT. Each blood-feed lasted until engorgement or termination (30 minutes). Only mosquitoes that were fully engorged were selected for further analysis. Three engorged mosquitoes per time point were chosen for analysis. </p><p>We have attempted to make this process clearer in the methods section under &#x02018;Preparation of blood fed mosquitoes&#x02019;.</p><p>The legends for figures 1, 2 and 3 have been expanded.</p><p>Comment 2: There is a lack of discussion topic of the complexity of using the tool in fieldwork regarding the possible species involved as hosts. According to the protocol described here, the volume would be enough to screen how many species? Does the protocol allow a focused or broad-spectrum host approach? The proof of concept was made with blood obtained from human and sheep, but how would be the use of the protocol in other works, considering that this is the final objective of the publication.</p><p>Response: We believe that we have already acknowledged the complexity in interpretation in our discussion, having referred to sampling bias, cross-reactivity, inability to identify all potential vertebrate hosts and the fact that the presence of antibody in a mosquito blood meal does not necessarily define that mosquito as a key vector. </p><p>Our proof of principle shows that the same mosquito blood meals can be used to identify the host origin of the blood meal and whether that host had been exposed to a target virus (in this case the arbovirus RRV). The technique provides clues to potential transmission pathways, but is not definitive.</p><p>We agree with the reviewer that a broad spectrum of hosts might be represented in mosquito blood meals. Although we used human and sheep blood for demonstration purposes, sequencing data from a single, tiny aliquot of serum can be matched to myriad vertebrate sequences available online.</p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0229314.s001"><label>Attachment</label><caption><p>Submitted filename: <named-content content-type="submitted-filename">Response to Reviewers_Gyawali et al_ 050620.docx</named-content></p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0229314.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></body></sub-article><sub-article id="pone.0229314.r003" article-type="aggregated-review-documents"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0229314.r003</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision Letter 1</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Moreira</surname><given-names>Luciano Andrade</given-names></name><role>Academic Editor</role></contrib></contrib-group><permissions><copyright-statement>&#x000a9; 2020 Luciano Andrade Moreira</copyright-statement><copyright-year>2020</copyright-year><copyright-holder>Luciano Andrade Moreira</copyright-holder><license xlink:href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"><license-p>This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution License</ext-link>, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.</license-p></license></permissions><related-article id="rel-obj003" ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.1371/journal.pone.0229314" related-article-type="reviewed-article"/><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>Submission Version</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></front-stub><body><p>
