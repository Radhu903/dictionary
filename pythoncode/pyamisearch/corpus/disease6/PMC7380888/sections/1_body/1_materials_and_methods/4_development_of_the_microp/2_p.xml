<p>All koala samples were also tested by a micro-PRNT technique using just three μl of koala sera; the approximate volume of a mosquito blood meal [
 <xref rid="pone.0229314.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Sera were diluted 1:20 in serum-free RPMI-1640. Equal volumes of diluted sera (50 μl) were then mixed with equal volumes of 30 pfu RRV per well (1:160 stock RRV in RPMI-1640) and added to duplicate wells (50 ul per well) of 96–well tissue culture plates (Nunclon, Thermo Scientific, Australia) containing a Vero cell monolayer. A virus density of 30 pfu per well in 96-well plates allowed sufficient visual discrimination of plaques [
