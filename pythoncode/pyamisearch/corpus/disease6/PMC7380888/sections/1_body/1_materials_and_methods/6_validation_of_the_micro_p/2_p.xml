<p>To validate the ability of the micro-PRNT to detect vertebrate anti-RRV antibodies from single, blood fed mosquitoes, we tested 
 <italic>Aedes notoscriptus</italic> that had been fed on human seropositive or seronegative volunteers. Blood-fed mosquitoes were harvested at various times post-feeding and processed as above (abdominal contents expelled into serum-free RPMI 1640 and adjusted to obtain a 20-fold dilution). Unfed mosquitoes were included as a control. Each 96-well plate was scanned and plaques were counted manually as described above.
