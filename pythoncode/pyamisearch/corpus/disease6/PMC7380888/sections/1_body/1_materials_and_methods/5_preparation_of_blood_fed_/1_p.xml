<p>Blood cells from defibrinated sheep blood (Serum Australis, Manilla, NSW, Australia) were pelleted, washed three times in PBS and then reconstituted in either RRV seropositive or RRV seronegative human sera at a physiological proportion of 1: 0.82 blood cell: plasma. The blood was previously confirmed to be seronegative for RRV by conventional PRNT. Female

 <italic>aegypti</italic> mosquitoes (aged 3–5 days) were starved for 5 hr to increase their avidity and then offered seropositive or seronegative blood for 30 min via a membrane feeding apparatus [
