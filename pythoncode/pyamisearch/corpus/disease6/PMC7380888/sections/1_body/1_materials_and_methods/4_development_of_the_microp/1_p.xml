<p>All koala serum samples were tested for neutralising RRV antibodies using a conventional PRNT approach. Equal volumes of sera (200 μl), diluted 1:20 in serum-free RPMI-1640, were mixed with an equal volume of 50 plaque forming units of RRV (1:800 stock RRV in RPMI-1640) per well of a 12-well tissue culture plate (Nunclon, Thermo Scientific, Australia). The virus-sera mixtures were incubated at 37°C for 45 min and added to infect Vero cell monolayers and incubated for a further two hours to enable non-neutralised virus to adsorb to cells. Following incubation, the virus-sera mixture was removed and 2 mL of 0.75% w/v carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC, Sigma-Aldrich) in RPMI 1640 was added. Plates were incubated at 37°C in 5% v/v CO
 <sub>2</sub> for an additional 40 hr. The CMC/RPMI medium was then removed, and the cell monolayers were fixed and stained with 0.05% w/v crystal violet (Sigma-Aldrich) in formaldehyde (1% v/v) and methanol (1% v/v). The cell monolayers were then rinsed in tap water, and the plates inverted on a paper towel until dry. Plaques (clear zones in a purple cell monolayer) were counted. Reductions of total virus plaque numbers per well of ≥50% were considered to denote seropositive status [
