<p>More than 75 arboviruses have been identified in Australia and a small number are associated with human infection [

 <xref rid="pone.0229314.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], Barmah Forest virus [
 <xref rid="pone.0229314.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], WNV strain Kunjin [
 <xref rid="pone.0229314.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], and the potentially fatal Murray Valley encephalitis virus [
 <xref rid="pone.0229314.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] are of the greatest public health concern. RRV is the most commonly notified arboviral disease but multiple vectors and many potential vertebrate hosts make this a complex zoonosis. There is little empirical evidence regarding its key transmission cycles or the factors that encourage their spillover to the human population [
