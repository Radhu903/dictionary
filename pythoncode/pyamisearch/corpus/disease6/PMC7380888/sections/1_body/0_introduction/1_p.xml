<p>Arthropod borne viruses (arboviruses) present a significant risk to public health globally. In recent decades, rapid urbanization and population growth have assisted the expansion of several viruses from having localised, rural, transmission cycles to being worldwide and urban problems [

Epidemiological cycles of many arboviruses, such as Ross River (RRV) and West Nile (WNV) incorporate complex transmission networks involving multiple vertebrate hosts and many vectors. Humans are not necessarily key components of these transmission networks, but increasing human travel, trade and deforestation bring humans into contact with sylvatic/enzootic cycles. This can stimulate arbovirus emergence, re-emergence and spillover into human populations [
