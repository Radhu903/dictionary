In this alternative approach, we exploit the fact that vertebrate antibodies persist within mosquito blood meals for some time after the mosquito has fed on a seropositive host. We demonstrate that a micro-PRNT technique can identify vertebrate RRV antibodies in small volumes of sera and mosquito blood meals. This has utility as part of an integrated xenodiagnostic approach that exploits the capture of single blood-fed mosquitoes to infer mosquito species, host preference and host exposure to disease. This will help prioritise potential transmission pathways for further study.
