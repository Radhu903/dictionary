<p>One means of identifying likely vertebrate disease reservoirs is to demonstrate their historical exposure to disease by searching for virus-specific antibodies in animal sera or tissues. Development of antibody is the major immune response to infection with parasites and pathogens including arboviruses [

 <xref rid="pone.0229314.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. While such serological evidence of infection does not prove that an animal is an amplifying host or key reservoir, it does allow the generation of hypotheses about probable pathways and is especially useful when combined with information on mosquito species and their host preference. Serological surveys of blood meals are likely to be more fruitful than the direct identification of viruses because vertebrates are only viraemic for a few days, only a small proportion of mosquitoes are virus positive and there is a diminishingly small probability that a captured mosquito will be carrying a virus positive mosquito blood meal. A tremendous sampling effort is therefore required to incriminate reservoir and vector pathways by virus isolation alone.
