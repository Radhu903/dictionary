<p>Mosquito blood meals obtained from mosquitoes membrane-fed on sheep blood mixed with anti-RRV human antibodies neutralised RRV by â‰¥50% until 60 hr post blood feeding (

In contrast, there was no neutralisation of blood meals obtained from mosquitoes fed with sheep blood supplemented with RRV seronegative human serum. These assays demonstrated that the micro-PRNT is robust across a range of dilutions that are likely to represent varying antibody levels in the host.
