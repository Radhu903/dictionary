<p>As for all serum or tissue collection techniques, reliance on blood-fed mosquitoes as a sampling tool will be subject to sampling bias. Mosquitoes may be differentially attracted to diseased hosts [
 <xref rid="pone.0229314.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] or to species that are uncharacteristically abundant at any single point in time. Different mosquito trapping techniques have differential vector specific targets, so using one particular trap type might miss key vector species. In terms of serology, there may be considerable cross reaction between some virus antibodies [
 <xref rid="pone.0229314.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In this case RRV is likely to cross-react with the closely related alphavirus, Barmah Forest virus, whose epidemiology in Queensland remains significant [
 <xref rid="pone.0229314.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Finally, those reservoirs inferred by blood meal analysis may not be the key amplifying host, and the mosquitoes incriminated may not be the key vector. For example, dengue antibodies are commonly found in 
 <italic>Culex</italic> spp. mosquitoes during epidemics, but those mosquitoes do not transmit the disease. Nonetheless their blood meals may still identify the host and its sero-prevalence rate [
 <xref rid="pone.0229314.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. For all of these reasons, the various components of the pathways implicated by the micro-PRNT technique and attendant host identifications must be interpreted and prioritised in the light of all the available knowledge on the ecology of the disease.
