<p>There was a â‰ˆ10% inhibition of virus pfu by mosquito tissue homogenates (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0229314.g003">Fig 3</xref>). However, this inhibition was minimal compared to the threshold used to determine positive neutralisation (&gt;50% reduction). One possible explanation of this observation is that some component of abdominal tissue may have an inhibitory effect on virus replication.
