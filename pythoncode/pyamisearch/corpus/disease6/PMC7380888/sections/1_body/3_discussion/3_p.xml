<p>Our micro-PRNT could detect ≥50% RRV neutralisation by mosquito blood meals up to 36–48 hr post blood-feeding. Although this is the first study to have identified RRV antibodies in mosquito blood meals, more general studies have shown that antibodies can survive in those environments. Hatfield (1988) identified Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) specific antibodies using antibody-captured ELISA from the hemolymph of

 <italic>aegypti</italic> blood meals for 36 to 48 hr post-feeding [

 <italic>Anopheles stephensi</italic> [

These extended periods are surprising given that one would expect blood meals and their proteins to have been fully digested by then but the persistence of antibodies in mosquito blood meals will differ with species, ambient temperature, body size, initial concentration of antibodies, blood meal volume and the length of the gonotrophic cycle. In our study, the period of detectability (48–60 hr) corresponded to the period that blood was externally visible in the abdomen (
