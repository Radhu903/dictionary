<p>The small volumes of homogenate left from a single mosquito after execution of the micro-PRNT allows for a parallel PCR amplification for identification of the blood meal source (the host). The literature commonly reports that the origin of host blood meals can be identified from as a little as 0.02 μl of blood [
