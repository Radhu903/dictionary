<p>The accuracy of the micro-PRNT for testing RRV antibodies in this study compared favourably with a conventional PRNT method when applied to our koala samples. Similarly, confluent results were reported for a micro-PRNT tested against yellow fever virus in artificially spiked serum samples [

 <xref rid="pone.0229314.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]; both require host-specific antibodies and the latter demands considerable laboratory resources. Our micro-PRNT demonstrates sufficient sensitivity, specificity and utility for the determination of RRV antibodies in blood-fed mosquitoes that have fed on any vertebrate.
