<p>All mosquitoes were from established, uninfected colonies. The sero-status of human volunteers was confirmed by standard PRNT. Each blood-feed lasted until engorgement or termination (30 minutes). Only mosquitoes that were fully engorged were selected for further analysis. Three engorged mosquitoes per time point were chosen for analysis. </p>
