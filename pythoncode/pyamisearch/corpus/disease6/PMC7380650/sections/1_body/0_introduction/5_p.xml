<p>While the risk to transfusion safety is currently small, a potential outbreak of ZIKV would threaten blood supply safety in vulnerable locations [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008438.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Minimization strategies and quantification of this risk are therefore warranted, should local transmission occur. Indeed, the Australian Red Cross Lifeblood (Lifeblood, formerly Blood Service) has several risk minimization strategies to ensure the risk of transfusion-transmitted ZIKV is minimal [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008438.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. For example, blood donors must have i) satisfactorily completed a confidential interview and health assessment that includes a questionnaire on past and present medical conditions [
