<p>Transmission of arboviruses via blood transfusion has been reported for dengue viruses (DENVs) and West Nile virus (WNV) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008438.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], and suspected for other arboviruses. In Australia, outbreaks of DENVs and Ross River virus (RRV) threaten blood transfusion safety [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008438.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Zika virus (ZIKV), closely related to DENVs and WNV, is an emerging arbovirus with potential for transfusion-transmission [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008438.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>–
 <xref rid="pntd.0008438.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. ZIKV may be detected in serum or plasma for 1–2 weeks after infection and persists for longer periods of time in whole blood, red blood cells, semen, and urine [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008438.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>–
 <xref rid="pntd.0008438.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Therefore, ZIKV presents yet another challenge to blood transfusion providers and to public health generally, as transfusion recipients could develop ZIKV-related disease following transfusion.
