<p>Accurate estimations of the risk of transfusion-transmitted ZIKV in Australia are essential for monitoring the safety of the blood supply and evaluating the effectiveness of the donor questionnaire and identifying the potential need for new screening tests. In this study, we hypothesized that if ZIKV were to be imported into a region with an established vector population during a period of suitable environmental conditions, transmission would be possible, and the blood transfusion supply would be potentially at risk. Although previous estimates of the epidemic potential by Viennet

 <italic>et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008438.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] show that areas of north-eastern Australia could sustain local transmission of ZIKV, we now incorporate both vectors and explicitly account for sexual transmission. Based on previous work, we aimed to: i) calculate the basic reproduction numbers for ZIKV via mosquito-borne (

 </sub>; iii) estimate the number of people infected during potential local transmission events; and iv) assess the associated risk to blood transfusion safety. Estimating the risk of ZIKV transfusion-transmission is an important part of risk assessments and informs decisions regarding when and which risk mitigation strategies should be implemented.
