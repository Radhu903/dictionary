<p>The distribution of

 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> populations after introduction declined over time in Adelaide, Hobart and Melbourne. In Perth, while the density of the population declined for the former, it slightly increased over time for the latter. As for the other UCLs, the density of the 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> population did not change much over time, while 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> density decreased in Darwin and increased in Sydney over time. For both species, the correlation between the density of host-seeking females (mosquito population density) was slightly above average (R = 0.6, p &lt; 2.2e-16) (
