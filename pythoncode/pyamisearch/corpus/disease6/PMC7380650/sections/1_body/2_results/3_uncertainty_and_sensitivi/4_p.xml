<p>Sensitivity analyses for 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> showed that all parameters except the intrinsic incubation period in humans, the duration of acute phase, the duration of extrinsic incubation period, the mosquito lifespan and the human population density had a significant and low positive impact on

 <sub>
  <italic>hv</italic>
 </sub> outcomes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008438.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). Also as expected, the average temperature was significantly and highly correlated to the biting rate (R
 <sup>2</sup> = 1). The mosquito population and human population densities had a significant and low positive impact on the probability of vector to human transmission per bite, the proportion of symptomatic infections and the intrinsic incubation period in humans. For 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic>, the mosquito population density, probability of vector to human transmission per bite, vector control rate, proportion of symptomatic infections, the relative human-to-mosquito transmission probability of exposed humans to symptomatically infected humans and average daily vector biting rate had a significant and low positive impact on
