<p>Eleven UCLs in Australia were selected for modelling: Adelaide, Hobart, and Melbourne, which have never had established 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> populations; Brisbane, Darwin, Perth, and Sydney, which previously had established 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> populations but for which there is no recent evidence of permanent 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> populations; and Cairns, Rockhampton, Thursday Island (Torres Strait) and Townsville, which have established 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> populations (and also have experienced local dengue virus activity) [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008438.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. The density of human populations were obtained from the Australian Bureau of Statistics [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008438.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] from the 1996, 2001, 2006 and 2011 census data with linear interpolation for inter-census years. 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> is known only to be established in the Torres Strait, Australia [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008438.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. We obtained the mean maximum and minimum temperatures from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology and calculated the average temperature for each month from January 1996 â€“December 2015 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008438.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Finally, we used the container-inhabiting mosquito simulation (CIMSiM) model, which is driven by daily meteorological observations, mosquito food availability, availability of various breeding sites (containers) and human demographic data to estimate the density of

 <italic>albopictus</italic> host-seeking females [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008438.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], that we defined below as mosquito population density. CIMSiM has been previously validated for its ability to simulate
