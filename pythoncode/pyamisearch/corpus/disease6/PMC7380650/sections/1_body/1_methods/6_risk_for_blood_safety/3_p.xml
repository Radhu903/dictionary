<p>Based on an asymptomatic rate of ZIKV infection ranging from 50 to 80% [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008438.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0008438.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], we fixed the proportion of undetected cases at 65%. As explained above, the number of infections reported was estimated by year and UCLs using the 
 <italic>AR</italic>. The population size represented the number of individuals in the outbreak-affected region (UCL here) and estimated previously. The blood component production data from 2009 to 2015 were obtained from Lifeblood databases. The other parameters were taken from Coghlan 
 <italic>et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008438.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. We then estimated the risk of infected components being released by dividing the total number of products obtained from individual donations per year N with the estimated number of infected components released in year N. Given the severe clinical consequences to an infected foetus, the large proportion of asymptomatic cases, and the detection of ZIKV RNA in asymptomatic blood donors, we purposely did not adopt a numerical risk threshold as a trigger for additional risk mitigation for ZIKV, as this would have been too subjective, but rather adopted levels of risk (very low, low, medium, high) as a trigger for additional risk mitigation for ZIKV.
