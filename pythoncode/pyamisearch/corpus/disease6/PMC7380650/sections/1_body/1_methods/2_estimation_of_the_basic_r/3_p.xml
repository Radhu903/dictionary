<p>Estimation was performed using the software R [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008438.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>] (version 3.4.1). Several assumptions were made to perform the analyses. ZIKV was assumed to be introduced into an immunologically na√Øve population. We also hypothesized that: i) either an 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> population or an 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> population is the only vector present in each UCL (i.e. not both at once); ii) the mosquito population is modelled accurately by CIMSiM and that all 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> are wild-type (not infected with 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic>); iii) the human population undergoes linear growth throughout study period and ignores births and deaths; iv) vector control is present and consistent between UCLs; v) only symptomatic infections are considered infectious; vi) the protective effect of herd immunity is not considered. All parameter descriptions are summarized in
