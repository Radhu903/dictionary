<p>Finally, we utilized the European Up-Front Risk Assessment Tool (EUFRAT- version 2.2.31, 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://eufrattool.ecdc.europa.eu/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://eufrattool.ecdc.europa.eu/</ext-link>) with estimated cumulative infections to assess the transfusion-transmission risk from predicted potentially infected blood donors. EUFRAT has a web-based interface and was commissioned by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) to quantify the transmission risk through blood transfusion during outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008438.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. The conceptual basis of the EUFRAT is further described in Kiely 
 <italic>et al</italic>. (2017) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008438.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. Several assumptions were made to perform the analyses with EUFRAT: (i) blood donors had the same risk as any other individual; (ii) there was no effect of infection on donation behaviour; (iii) infections were evenly distributed over the interval considered; iv) the duration of infectivity was constant and fixed at 14 days; v) blood components (red blood cells, platelets, and plasma products) from viraemic blood donors transmit infection with 100% efficiency. EUFRAT does allow the user to enter a value for the proportion of the population that is immune, if that is known. If the proportion of the population that is immune is not known, the usual conservative assumption is to assume 0% immunity (i.e. 100% transmissibility), which is the case in this study.
