We showed that, to decrease the likelihood of ZIKV transmission through a mosquito bite, the priority should be to decrease the mosquito density, the probability of vector to human transmission, and the vector control rate. These priorities are reflected in the current strategies implemented in North Queensland to manage Dengue outbreak risk. Similarly, to decrease the likelihood of ZIKV transmission through sexual activities, the priority should be to decrease the transmission rate from symptomatically infected humans to susceptible humans, the relative human-to-human transmissibility of convalescent to symptomatic humans and, theoretically, the proportion of symptomatic infections. Accordingly, World Health Organization published guidance and recommendations, that are regularly updated as new evidence emerges, to provide advice on the prevention of sexual transmission of ZIKV [
