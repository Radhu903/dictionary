<p>This study contributes to assessing the epidemic potential of local ZIKV transmission via mosquito-borne and sexual transmission, and provides, for the first time, an estimation of the risk posed by ZIKV for blood transfusion safety in Australia. Our methods and results differ from Watson-Brown 
 <italic>et al</italic>. (2019) and highlight the difficulty in comparing different models. The salient point here is that each method can potentially produce a different estimate of 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>0</italic>
 </sub>. Therefore, using the basic reproduction number to predict an attack rate and ultimately, in our case, the risk for blood transfusion safety is dependent on the model employed. Nonetheless, estimation of 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>0</italic>
 </sub> can potentially provide valuable insights during epidemics and guide public health interventions. We believe that the methodology employed in our study is easily reproducible in settings where epidemiological and entomological parameters are well estimated and could be used to allow a timely assessment of arboviruses, such as dengue, chikungunya and Zika viruses.
