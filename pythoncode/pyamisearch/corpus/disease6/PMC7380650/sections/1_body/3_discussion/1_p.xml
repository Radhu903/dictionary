<p>Following the emergence of ZIKV in the Pacific and Latin America and given the serious sequelae accompanying congenital ZIKV exposure, extensive research has focused on better understanding and characterizing the consequences of ZIKV infection and transmission. Moreover, the possibility of transmitting infectious organisms via blood products and plasma derivatives is a major public health concern. This study fills a gap in our knowledge on the potential risk associated with ZIKV for Australian blood transfusion safety. We attempted to assess i) whether an epidemic could occur in main urban centres in Australia, following ZIKV introduction in areas with suitable conditions, and ii) how the safety of the blood supply would be impacted.</p>
