It also underscores the need to pursue investment in alternative riskâ€“mitigation strategies, such as pathogen inactivation (PI) or nucleic acid amplification testing (NAT) for maintaining blood transfusion safety in the face of an infectious disease outbreak. PI refers to prevention of infectivity of a pathogen through chemical and/or physical removal processes (e.g. nanofiltration) to inactivate infectious disease agents (i.e. viruses, bacteria and parasites) from blood [
