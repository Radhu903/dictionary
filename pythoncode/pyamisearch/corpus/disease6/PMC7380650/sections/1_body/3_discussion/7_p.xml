 <italic>et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008438.ref080" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. In order to avoid underestimating the risks for blood supply safety, we opted for an estimate of 20% symptomatic ZIKV infections. We also reasoned that a higher proportion of symptomatic acute infections would be identified and excluded through the blood donor questionnaire, which would further reduce the risk of collecting contaminated blood from asymptomatic donors.
