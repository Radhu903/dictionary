<p>In conclusion, our findings comprise theoretical evidence that ZIKV did not present a large threat to Australia but could become one if transmitted by 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> and/or 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> in Cairns, Darwin, Rockhampton and Thursday Island UCLs during the warmer months of the year, provided all the environmental conditions suitable for transmission were met. Mosquito surveillance and vector control are integral to preventing the range expansion of both vectors, especially into those locations with theoretical epidemic potential (i.e. Darwin). While the acute threat from the 2015â€“2016 ZIKV epidemics may have subsided and the current level of imported cases in Australia is low, preparedness for local transmission of ZIKV remains important, as an outbreak could have a significant impact on health, tourism and the blood supply. Although risk estimates necessarily include a measure of uncertainty, our risk assessment nonetheless provides a dynamic estimate of ZIKV epidemic potential and risk level for blood transfusion safety in key urban centres and localities of Australia and has the potential to inform decision making relating to the timing of supplementary fresh component restriction measures. This approach may be useful and applicable for other countries (France, Italy, Japan, and United States of America) where there is no endemic transmission of ZIKV, but vector populations are present and sexually transmitted infections are reported.
