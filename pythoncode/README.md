# python project to edit, and use dictionaries

## testing
Am currently having trouble with relative names in PyCharm. The following works
on CLI:

cd /Users/pm286/dictionary/pythoncode/test1
python -m project.package.demo

and
cd /Users/pm286/dictionary/pythoncode/
python -m pyamidict.editor.amidict

or using relative imports

python -m pyamidict.editor.amisearch 

or

python -m pyamidict.tests.test_editor

Make sure these run before rasing an issue
