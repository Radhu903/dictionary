**Index Oil186 Dictionaries**
=============================

This
[index](https://github.com/petermr/CEVOpen/blob/master/articleAnalysis/oil186/raw/DictionaryDescriptionsOIL186/INDEXofOIL186Dictionaries.md)
contains information about the Manually Created Dictionaries for OIL186.

*PLEASE NOTE: Rather than alphabetical order, are listed here in the logical
progression.*

**The purpose/function of Dictionaries:**

1.  *Identify “things” as objects or concepts (eg. “e.coli" is a concept.).*

2.  *Give each object clear lexical names by which they can be searched.*  
    *(An object that goes by more than one name is a synonym*.)

3.  *Give each object a link to wikidata (or other authorities) by which we can
    learn more about them.*

**EO​​ Analysis Method**
----------------------

[Analytical
chemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry) studies and uses
instruments and methods used
to [separate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_process), identify,
and [quantify](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantification_(science)) matter.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry#cite_note-isbn0-03-005938-0-1) In
practice, separation, identification or quantification may constitute the entire
analysis or be combined with another method. Separation
isolates [analytes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analyte). [Qualitative
analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualitative_inorganic_analysis) identifies
analytes, while [quantitative
analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_analysis_(chemistry)) determines
the numerical amount or concentration.

Analytical chemistry consists of classical, [wet chemical
methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wet_chemistry) and modern, [instrumental
methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry#instrumental_methods).[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry#cite_note-isbn0-03-002078-6-2) Classical
qualitative methods use separations such
as [precipitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precipitation_(chemistry)), [extraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraction_(chemistry)),
and [distillation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distillation). Identification
may be based on differences in color, odor, melting point, boiling point,
radioactivity or reactivity. Classical quantitative analysis uses mass or volume
changes to quantify amount. Instrumental methods may be used to separate samples
using [chromatography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatography), [electrophoresis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrophoresis) or [field
flow fractionation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_flow_fractionation).
Then qualitative and quantitative analysis can be performed, often with the same
instrument and may use [light
interaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy), [heat
interaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermodynamics), [electric
fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrochemistry) or [magnetic
fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_magnetic_resonance_spectroscopy).
Often the same instrument can separate, identify and quantify an analyte.

**EO Compound**
---------------

Essential Oils (EOs) are the concentrated hydrophobic liquid containing volatile
chemical compounds extracted from plants. Essential oils are also known as
volatile oils, ethereal oils, aetherolea, or simply as the oil of the plant from
which they were extracted, such as oil of clove.

Qualitative (constituent compounds) and quantitative (%) analysis of the
chemical composition of the tested Essential Oils (Extracts?), with each known
compound linked to its IUPAC International Chemical Identifier (InChI).
